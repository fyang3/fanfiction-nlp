A second trip to the local healing clinic -LRB- a hairline fracture -- easily fixed -RRB- and an awkward explanation to his mom later , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is back at home and condemned from leaving the house -- regardless of whether or not he wants to test out his new abilities . 
But despite the house arrest , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't help but smile . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mom seems pretty excited , too -- she witnessed his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) rock firsthand , and although she ca n't entirely grasp how it took Izuku ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fourteen years to figure out bending , she 's ecstatic for her son . 
She bustles around the house , pulling out ingredients from the pantry and trying to tap at her phone at the same time . 
`` Oh , I 'm so excited for you , Izuku ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ! Earthbending! Can you believe it ? I 'm going to make you a cake . And I 'll call your father -- oh ! He 'll be so surprised ! He might want to come back in when he has a free day to say congrats -- '' 
`` Mom . Mom -- thank you . I 'm happy you 're excited , too , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) interrupts , walking over and leaning on the kitchen counter . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) smiles warmly . `` But seriously , you do n't have to make me ($_Midoriya_Izuku) a cake . I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) kind of just want to go to bed right now , I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'm beat . '' 
She blinks , then beams back at him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . `` Oh , of course ! It 's been quite the day for you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) -- I should have figured you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'd want to sleep . '' 
She places her phone and rolling pin on the counter , shuffling over to her son . Standing on tiptoes , she deposits a kiss on Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's forehead . 
`` I 'm very proud of you , '' she says softly . `` You never gave up , did you ? '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) smiles , then shakes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head slowly . She holds his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoulders , tears beading at the corners of her eyes . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) kisses her forehead in turn , then pulling away to walk towards his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bedroom . 
`` Night , Mom . '' 
`` Goodnight , Izuku ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . '' 
The door closes behind him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) plops onto his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bed , dwelling on what a day it 's been . 
How could his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) life have changed so much in 24 hours ? How could he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) have gone from a non-bending nobody to the avatar ? 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) flops backwards , and then the overwhelming nature of what comes next hits him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to go back to_the_Spirit_World ($_to_the_Spirit_World) to talk to All Might and figure out his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) plan , pronto . 
The only method he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows of is sleep -- when he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) falls asleep , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) should be able to go there . 
So he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lays on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bed , staring blankly at the ceiling . 
This should be easy -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's supposedly the bridge between the human world and the Spirit World , so he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) should be able to cross over with no problem . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) just needs to focus , to try to meditate and cross that chasm . 
But as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gazes upwards and tries to clear his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts , muffled worries cloud his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mind . 
Why was n't I able to bend up until now ? What 's wrong with me ? 
Who do I talk to ? I do n't know what to do and I ca n't contact my only source of advice . 
What if I ca n't get into Yuuei ? How will I master bending if I do n't go there -- will I have to leave home ? Without telling my mom ? 
The_Spirit_World ($_The_Spirit_World) slips from his ($_The_Spirit_World) grasp and he ($_The_Spirit_World) shifts to his ($_The_Spirit_World) side with a weary sigh , resigning himself ($_The_Spirit_World) to a restless sleep . 
x
There 's no school the next day and his ($_The_Spirit_World) mom leaves the house telling him ($_The_Spirit_World) to stay put and rest -- but the second she closes the door behind her , he ($_The_Spirit_World) pulls on a jacket and slides on his ($_The_Spirit_World) shoes . 
He ($_The_Spirit_World) 's not well , but he ($_The_Spirit_World) ca n't rest easy until he ($_The_Spirit_World) knows the full extent of his ($_The_Spirit_World) bending abilities . He ($_The_Spirit_World) has to see if he ($_The_Spirit_World) can bend more than just earth and air . 
Past the back lot and under the cover of trees , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) comes to a stop . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head still has that cotton feeling that dulls his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) senses slightly , but overall he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels much more focused and refreshed . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) uncaps a waterbottle and places it on the ground , then goes to stand five feet away . 
First up : waterbending . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mimics the movements he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sees all the time on TV -- the back and forth , the pushing and pulling , the fluid arm circles . 
But the movements are too smooth , too gentle -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't figure out how to transfer his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) energy into the water without the powerful and decisive motions of earthbending . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries for a couple more minutes , then drops the positioning with a sigh . 
Okay , now for the one he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has even less hope with : firebending . 
It 's the same deal as waterbending ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) goes through the pro motions , sharp jabs and thrusts . But the sheer emotion equated with firebending , the power that those benders display -- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't tap into it . 
Sure , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's got fight in him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
But he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't seem to draw it out in the form of fire . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) treks back home , disappointed but not surprised . 
All that 's left to do now is to try to talk to All Might and get some answers . 
x
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries for a week : meditating , deep breathing , music . Anything to relax and help him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) cross over . 
But nothing works . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) always begins to think of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) troubles , to worry about the path ahead . 
It 's a cycle -- his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) anxiety means he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't make it to the Spirit World , but not getting to the Spirit World is causing him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) even more anxiety . It 's excessively stupid and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to calm down , to let his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) worries go . 
But he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't . That 's not in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nature . 
It 's after another failed attempt that Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hoists himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , blurry-eyed , from the bed . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) goes to sit at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) desk , head in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands , staring at the wood grain below . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's beginning to wonder if that whole thing with All_Might ($_All_Might) was a fever dream , that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's the avatar but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) never actually had that discussion with his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) predecessor . 
Why is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) so bad at this ? Was n't this supposed to come naturally ? 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stares at the desk for another second , then raises his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head . Reaching for his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) laptop , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) flips it open and frantically types . 
avatar life biographies 
It 's a dumb Google search , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows . But he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to know that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's not alone , that what he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's going through is normal . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) clicks the first link and begins to read . 
An airbending avatar , 10 lifetimes back , that did n't master all the elements until she was 36 . A firebending avatar , 3 lifetimes ago , that struggled consistently with going into the Avatar State . Another earthbender , 8 lifetimes past , that avoided all other kinds of bending , finding them foreign and difficult . 
The story that comforts him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) the most is All_Might ($_All_Might) 's . 
`` Avatar_Toshinori ($_Avatar_Toshinori) was reportedly unable to visit the_Spirit_World ($_to_the_Spirit_World) until he ($_Avatar_Toshinori) was eighteen , '' the article reads . `` When asked about the most difficult part of his ($_Avatar_Toshinori) journey to become a fully-realized avatar , he ($_Avatar_Toshinori) responded with : ` the spiritual aspect . ''' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stares at the words , a faint smile creeping on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's not alone . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's never been alone . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) struggle has been going on for centuries , and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's far from the first avatar to not know what to do . 
Even when a deep tiredness settles into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bones , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) continues to scroll through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) past lives . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels connected . 
When he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begins to doze off , cheek on the desk and eyes still on the computer , there 's something like a humming that leaks into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ears . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lets his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes sink shut , and the humming overtakes him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , filling his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ears and sinking into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) limbs . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lets it engulf him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
x
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can sense the difference before his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes even flick open . 
The air around him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels lighter , the ache of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) limbs fading and the weight of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyelids lessening . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) blinks , taking in the familiar clearing and lush greenery . But a quick survey shows that the former avatar is nowhere to be seen . 
A sense of panic settles in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) core . 
`` All_Might ($_All_Might) ? '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) questions quietly . Only silence greets him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . Then it hits him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
It 's just silence -- no noise from the babbling stream or the insects from within the trees , like last time . Simply eerie quietness , thick and foreboding . 
Something 's wrong . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) whips around , suddenly growing paranoid that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's being watched . The landscape seems to darken , the shadows in between trees growing blacker and the foliage taking on a gray tint . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nervously scans , trying to find the source of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) unease . 
A wave of something hits him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , grim and heavy . Gravity seems to grow exponentially stronger but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fights it , struggling to stay upright and standing . Then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sees it . 
Maybe it 's his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) imagination -- there 's shifting on a tree 15 feet to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) left , almost a crawling motion , digits spidering their way across the trunk . Pale fingers ... 
A hand , but not attached to a body . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chokes back a muffled cry of horror , stumbling a step before turning and sprinting in the opposite direction . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) runs from that evil aura , the emotions of hatred and vengeance and never-ending loneliness that threaten to swallow him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) whole . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is no expert on the_Spirit_World ($_to_the_Spirit_World) , but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows that that is not supposed to be there . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wheezes and weaves between trees , attempting to get away as fast as possible . 
The invading emotions slowly fade as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) puts distance between him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and the thing , to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) relief . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) slows down and leans against the thick trunk of a towering tree , trying to catch his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) breath . 
But a new sensation appears , less of a feeling and more of a magnetic pull . It 's the polar opposite of what he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) felt merely a few minutes ago : it 's hope , it 's reassurance and guidance . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) straightens up , tiredly shuffling in what he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thinks is the right direction . 
It is n't a far walk -- only about five minutes -- until he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) reaches the edge of the forest , the overhead canopy making way to purple blue sky and sloping green hills . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) merely blinks slowly , until a voice calls his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) name somewhere to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) left . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) turns to see the former avatar , picking his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) way over tree roots towards him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
Thank god . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) walks over to meet him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , the man 's presence putting him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) at ease . 
`` You have n't been here in a while , my boy , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says , clapping Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) on the back like an old friend rather than some kid he 's only met once . `` Troubles getting back to the Spirit World ? '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shrinks . `` Yes ... It took me ($_Midoriya_Izuku) a bit to figure out how to get here , but I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) think I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 've got it now . '' 
`` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'm glad -- I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 've got a feeling that there would have been trouble , had you learned any later . '' 
The man gives him a small smile and a final back pat , then turning to sit on a raised tree root . He seems relaxed , nonchalant . 
But something in his words bother Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . He hesitates , then asks . 
`` What do you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mean by ` trouble ? ''' 
All_Might ($_All_Might) freezes , like he 's been caught in some secret act . It ($_All_Might) feels ... weird , pressing his childhood hero to share information with him , but Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stays firm , fixing his mentor with a questioning stare . 
He has to familiarize himself with his past life . They have to be open with each other , and that connection starts with no secrets . 
Something in Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's look must tell All_Might ($_All_Might) this ; he sighs . 
`` Well , I suppose you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) would 've learned sooner or later , anyhow , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says , scooching to the left and patting the root next to him . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pauses , then walks over to sit . 
There 's a moment of silence as All_Might ($_All_Might) formulates what to say ; he fiddles those long fingers of his and stares straight ahead . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) just watches his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands , letting the avatar think . 
The fingers stop promptly and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) locks eyes with his mentor , now donning a grim expression . 
`` I 'll cut to the chase : something dark is on the horizon , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says , black eyes boring into Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's . `` For both your world and mine . '' 
`` What ... What is it ? '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) asks hesitantly . 
All_Might ($_All_Might) sighs . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wish that I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knew , my ($_Midoriya_Izuku) boy . '' 
`` Well , what makes you think that , then ? Have you been seeing something , had to fight someone ? '' 
All_Might ($_All_Might) rises and stands in front of Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , almost as if the very thought of evil on the horizon makes him restless . 
`` There 's a group -- a league , I should say -- that has been dabbling with affairs in both the human world and the_Spirit_World ($_to_the_Spirit_World) . I 've spotted them a few times here , and some of my human correspondents in your realm have gotten glances , too . '' All Might scratches at the top of his head , staring off into the woods . `` They 're not sending people here so much as they are sending entities ... Always a cloud of dark mist or a hand ... '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shudders and All_Might ($_All_Might) stops . 
`` Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ? Did you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) see one of them ? '' 
The boy fidgets . “Um, yes.” He fiddles with his fingers , looking down at the ground . `` I thought I spotted a hand ... It felt like it was watching me . . And it was radiating these awful emotions ... '' 
All Might mutters curses under his breath , stepping forward to place a hand on Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's shoulders . 
`` I 'm sorry you had to witness that , my boy . I would be lying if I told you I knew what that thing is up to -- but I can say this , '' he says , locking eyes with his successor . `` Do n't try to find out what it is . Not yet.” 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) breathes sharply . `` But , All Might -- '' 
`` You ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 're not ready to face off with whatever this is , '' he cuts Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) off . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) understand you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) want to help , but for now the best thing you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can do is lay low and train . You ($_Midoriya_Izuku) have a lot of missed time to make up for . '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has a point -- what could Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) even do right now ? The boy slumps a little , the argument lost . 
`` Do n't worry , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says . `` It has n't done anything too villainous , as of yet . Plus , I ($_All_Might) have contacts in the real world that are trying to find its source . We 'll know what it is , soon enough . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tenses at `` contacts , '' recalling what he came here to ask about . `` Uh , All_Might ($_All_Might) , about the real world ... '' 
`` You ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 're not sure what you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 're supposed to be doing , right ? '' All_Might ($_All_Might) responds . `` We 're connected -- I ($_All_Might) can feel your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) confusion and apprehension towards the task at hand . '' 
The words stolen from his mouth , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) freezes for a second , then nods weakly . He shrugs away from the avatar 's grasp , rising from his seat and starting a nervous pace . 
`` I do n't even know where to start , '' he mutters , hand on his chin as he walks back and forth . `` Do I just come out and announce it ... '' 
`` Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . '' 
`` Or keep it quiet -- '' 
`` Breathe . '' 
`` Or just train in one element , or -- '' 
`` You 're overthinking this , my boy . '' 
`` But am I ? '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) frantically shoots back , stopping in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tracks . 
All_Might ($_All_Might) pauses , then belts out a laugh . 
It 's contagious -- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't help but crack into a smile , then a chuckle , and then a full laugh . 
They both laugh longer than the situation warrants , but when they finally stop , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels more relaxed . Something about the avatar just calls for calm -- in the face of the daunting , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) still manages to put on a smile . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) was n't the `` most charismatic avatar '' for nothing , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) guesses . 
`` I ($_All_Might) 'm sorry to laugh , kid -- I ($_All_Might) 'm just very happy to see you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) so serious about this , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says , seating himself again . `` Okay , back to business . You ($_Midoriya_Izuku) know the traditional path an avatar takes . '' 
`` Yes : you 're told of their role when you turn sixteen and then you embark on your journey to master the elements . You go in the order of the Avatar Cycle -- for me , that would be earth , fire , air , water , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) says . `` But I 've already diverged from all of that . '' 
`` True , '' the former avatar agrees . `` You 're making yourself out to be quite the nontraditional case . But that 's okay . Some of the best avatars of the past have strayed from the tradition and turned out perfectly fine . '' 
`` Yeah , but I bet all of them were able to bend before they turned fourteen , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) murmurs , earning a sad look from All_Might ($_All_Might) . 
`` You ca n't dwell on that , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , '' the man says softly . `` You 're a unique case . '' 
`` What did you say it was -- that my energy was blocked ? '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) questions . `` How did it suddenly get unblocked ? Why was it blocked in the first place ? '' 
`` Like I said earlier -- it was a combination of different factors : emotional stunting , insecurity , et cetera , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) replies , shifting on his perch . He scratches the top of his head , looking somewhere off into the landscape behind Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's shoulder . `` And -- er , this is n't for certain , but ... it may have also been my fault . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tenses . “What?” 
The avatar sighs . `` My fight with All For One did n't just leave my body scarred . They tried to keep it from the public -- it would have sent everything into even more chaos , if they had -- but : there was a spiritual aspect to what the Rebellion was trying to accomplish , as well . 
`` All For One had two main goals : firstly , to gain control of Harmony ($_Harmony) and , by extent , all four nations . But their second , more ominous goal , was ... crazy . Theoretically impossible. Unless , that is , you had a stable bridge to take you back and forth from the Spirit World . '' 
`` He was interested in looking for bending energy sources in the Spirit World -- that is , places that could ` grant ' bending . I guess you could say he wanted to become a pseudo-avatar . '' 
It 's faint -- a slight hesitancy to All_Might ($_All_Might) 's words , a tiny pause that drops like lead into Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's stomach . 
Is he afraid ? 
In an instant , All_Might ($_All_Might) suddenly seems so much smaller , so much more scared and lost and dead . 
Is this what 's in store for me , too ? Or will it be worse ? 
He shudders as All_Might ($_All_Might) begins to speak again . 
`` Now , whether places like that actually exist is entirely beyond my knowledge -- or if I could even take people with me when crossing worlds , but ... All For One wanted me to bring him to the Spirit World , regardless . And he was going to do it by force . '' 
`` So ... you were n't just fighting to stop them from taking Harmony ($_Harmony) , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) says . `` You were fighting to avoid being captured , too . '' 
All_Might ($_All_Might) nods . `` And what a fight it ($_All_Might) was . It ($_All_Might) took everything I had to hold him at bay . I 'm guessing you already know this , but I had to go into the_Avatar_State ($_the_Avatar_State) . No small feat , but it ($_the_Avatar_State) worked and I almost had him finished . But then I got hit . '' He grimaces at the memory , placing a hand over his concealed wound . `` I think that this was the first factor in blocking your energy . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) furrows his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) brow . `` But ... sustaining injuries in the_Avatar_State ($_the_Avatar_State) is n't enough to end the_Cycle ($_the_Cycle) . Or block energy . '' 
`` You 're right , the injury itself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) was n't what did it ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , '' the man replies , with a hint of ... embarrassment ? Shame ? `` But after taking that hit , I was ... I did n't know if I would win , and I did n't want to be the one to end the_Cycle ($_the_Cycle) . So I went out of the_State ($_the_Avatar_State) for the rest of the fight . '' 
A lightbulb goes off in Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's head . 
`` You were ashamed that you got scared for yourself , '' he states . `` And ashamed that you left the_State ($_the_Avatar_State) , even though staying in it ($_the_Avatar_State) could have ended the fight a lot sooner and saved more of the city . So you blocked a chakra point . '' 
All_Might ($_All_Might) blinks . `` Er . Yes. It seems like you know something about chakras . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) flushes , waving his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands in apology . `` Oh , I 'm so sorry -- that was insensitive of me -- '' 
`` No , my boy , it 's fine . '' All_Might ($_All_Might) gives him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) a small smile . `` Butting your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head into other people 's business is the mark of a good avatar . And it 's good to see you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) already know about your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chakras -- those are important . '' 
The blood does n't leave Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's face , and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) squeaks out a thank you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
`` So yes , like you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) said , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) starts again slowly . `` I did n't resolve my own emotional issues in my lifetime , and ended up clogging my fire chakra -- willpower , blocked by shame . '' 
`` But why would that block all of my bending ? '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) questions . 
`` Well -- my theory is that I did n't just have one chakra clogged . '' The man raises his right hand and points an index finger at his forehead . `` Thought chakra . Pure cosmic energy , blocked by worldly attachments . And I passed on with a lot of people that I wanted to save and a lot of people I wanted to bring to justice . '' 
`` And you think that carried over into my chakras , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) concludes . 
`` I 'll say that I was never quite as good at the whole ` spiritual aspect ' as some of the former avatars . So I do n't know if my running theory actually works , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says . `` And while I 've come to terms with my fate and emotions , I had to fix the Thought Chakra in person -- but some sort of disconnect between us kept you from coming here for fourteen years . '' 
So that 's what the whole forehead thing was last time , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thinks . But what kind of disconnect ... 
`` But what 's important is that you 're here now and you 've already bended two elements , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says , interrupting Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's thoughts . `` You 've also attempted water and fire , correct ? '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nods . `` But I was n't able to do either . I ca n't really figure out what I should be feeling when I bend those . '' 
`` Do n't rush it , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) advises . `` You 've only just entered the bending world , so start with earth , move to air , and then attempt the other two . Every avatar has an element they struggle with -- mine was fire . '' He looks Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) up and down . `` And I feel like yours will be , as well . '' 
`` How can you tell ? '' 
All Might tents his hands , fingertips on his lips . `` You 'll find that most firebenders have found sources for their bending that are ... Self-destructive . Angry . Not the true essence of what firebending is intended to be . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's brain spits out a mental picture of a snarling Kacchan , which he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoves down immediately . 
`` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feel as though you 've only ever witnessed that kind of firebending in your life . You might attempt to start off on the wrong foot , without the right master , '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) continues . `` And even then , it may take some time . The meanings of each element must be learned -- and as someone who 's always been on the receiving end of an angry firebender , its meaning might not come easy . '' 
The knowing look All_Might ($_All_Might) gives Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tells him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows all about Bakugou . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) returns a nervous smile . 
`` It will take time of course . I know you want to have a step-by-step plan , something to follow to the letter . But you must remember : a large aspect of being the avatar is following the flow of energy . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) must look confused , because the former avatar sighs . 
`` The flow -- whether it be in your bending , in conflicts , in your own life . You must learn to adapt accordingly and make split second decisions for the good of mankind , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says . `` While I ($_All_Might) am here to give you advice , I ($_All_Might) am not always going to be there when you need to make tough choices in the spur of the moment . '' 
The boy already knew all that , but something about All Might saying it aloud makes it more real . 
`` Your hardships and battles will be different than mine ($_All_Might) . You can not copy me ($_All_Might) -- that 'll only end in tragedy . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gazes up at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) predecessor , the weight of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) words settling on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoulders . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can ask for guidance , but the final decisions will be up to him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can save the world , but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) might not be able to save himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
The nod of understanding he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gives feels like the click of a lock on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) heart . There 's no backing out ; his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fate is intertwined with that of the world . 
All_Might ($_All_Might) responds with a grim smile . 
`` So tell me ($_All_Might) , '' the man says , rising and turning to thread his way into the shadows of the trees . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begins to follow , only to have the scenery around him flicker out like a lightbulb . He 's once again in that black void , nothing but him , darkness , and the boom of his mentor 's voice . 
`` What are you going to do ? '' 
He trains like hell . 
If he 's going to train under anyone , he needs to make sure that his bones do n't shatter first . 
His immediate goal : fortify his plans for the future , fortify his body , and fortify his mind . 
Step number one : build muscle , work on power output , and prep himself for the Yuuei ($_Yuuei) entrance exam . 
He 's been doing this for years -- fragmenting his long term goals into smaller ones , staving off the pressure of his future by compartmentalizing it . He 'll still have to save the world someday , but for now he just has to focus on getting into Yuuei ($_Yuuei) . 
As to why he 's so dead set on Yuuei ($_Yuuei) ... it 's less of a specific reason and more of a feeling . 
Simply put , it feels like fate . 
-LRB- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't deny that All Might attending the school in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) youth plays a big factor in the magnetism of the school . -RRB- 
But the abundance of masters teaching there , the interdisciplinary focus in the bending , the probable contacts All_Might ($_All_Might) has there -- it seems like a place specifically founded to groom avatars . 
So Yuuei it is . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) life becomes a collage of bending matches , gyms , and the quiet lot behind his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) house . Anywhere where no one will stop him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) from practicing . When he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's not in school , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's sweating -- pulling up rocks , seeing which moves work for him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and which ones do n't . 
The internet helps him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) more than he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) would like to admit . Step-by-step power position tutorials , workout regiments , bending match videos -- they 're abundant and easily accessible , and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) compiling all of their combined knowledge together until he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has a semblance of an actual workout schedule . 
x
There are two aspects to the Yuuei practical exam : power and combat . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can learn combat moves by himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) by watching pro matches -- but the power portion might prove to be a challenge , without direction . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't figure out how to increase his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) power . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has a set limit , but honestly , it 's not enough . 
But when your mentor was notoriously good at interdisciplinary bending and using all of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) might in the fighting ring , it seems wasteful to just let that expertise slide . 
So Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) back in the Spirit World two weeks after their last encounter , luckily encountering no shadowy hands . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pitches his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) idea to All Might : teach Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) the motions and logistics of a power-maximizing earthbending move to help him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pass the exam . 
The proposition brings a smile to All_Might ($_All_Might) 's face . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) beams , then places a large hand on Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's head . 
`` Do n't worry , '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) assures . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) have just the move in mind . '' 
x
It 's backbreaking work . Even sleep no longer offers a refuge , due to power sessions with All_Might ($_All_Might) . 
School , combat training , power practice , repeat . The months fly by and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hardly notices . 
Of course there are moments when he doubts what he 's doing -- is Yuuei ($_Yuuei) actually worth this ? He 's the avatar -- ca n't he put off the hellish training until later ? He 's going to get a master no matter what , so why panic ? 
But as buzzes of the entrance exam begin to dance around the classroom , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is painfully reminded that this is him catching up . That what he 's doing right now is making up for fourteen years of inactivity , fourteen years of missed bending experience . 
If he wants to train with the best , he has to put himself on equal footing first -- his spiritual title does not give him to a free ride to Yuuei . 
So despite his doubts , despite his fatigue , he pushes forward . He sees results . 
He 's sturdier , in mind and in body . He has an artillery of combat actions at his disposal . He has an All Might specialty move , guaranteed to max his power output . 
When ten months are up and the exam looms over the horizon , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) actually feels like he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's standing at the starting line . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shuffles past the Yuuei ($_Yuuei) gates , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) throat in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stomach and his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) legs trembling . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) did okay on the written portion -- a lot of it was interdisciplinary bending logistics , the history of bending , and what-would-you-do scenarios . There were only one or two he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) did n't know at all , and a couple more he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) was hesitant about , but it seems likely he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) scored well . 
Now comes the tough part . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's forcing himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) to be calm , clasping his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands together to stop their shaking and taking deep , controlled breaths . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) closes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes . 
The worst that can happen is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to go to another bending school . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's prepared for this . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's done as much as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can . It 's all a matter of showing that work now . 
Slightly calmer , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's eyes flick back open . A small smile creeps onto his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) takes a big step forward -- 
Directly into a rock jutting out of the pavement . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) topples but his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mind stays strangely clear . 
Of course , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) brain sighs , resigned to its fate . Of COURSE you have to fall and break your arm right before the biggest exam of your life . You would n't be Midoriya Izuku if you did n't pull some clutzy move like this . So stupid. 
Right before he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gets a faceful of asphalt , however , there 's a whoosh and suddenly he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is n't falling . 
In fact , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's floating . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's eyes go wide and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) yelps , scrambling to get upright . The air begins to assist him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) upwards , bringing him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) from 20ş to 90ş . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feet firmly planted on the ground again , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) turns to find his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) savior . 
`` Are you okay ? '' A short girl with a gravity-defying bob smiles worriedly at him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , arms still raised from bending . Her big brown eyes look him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) up and down , questioning and caring . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) merely stares . 
`` Sorry for not asking before using my ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bending on you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , '' she continues , shifting her hands to grasp the strap of the satchel at her hip . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) figured it would be bad luck to trip before the exam ! '' 
She tilts her head and beams . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nearly go into cardiac arrest . 
`` Uh , '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eloquently responds . 
`` Well , we better get inside -- they 're starting soon . I 'm so nervous ! But let 's both do our best , okay ? '' 
`` Um , '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries again . 
`` Good luck ! '' she says , turning to continue her way across the courtyard . Only his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes follow , watching the swish of her yellow skirt as she climbs the stairs and vanishes inside the building . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't think of how mortifying that was . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't think of how experienced the benders he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's up against must be , for that girl to pull such a controlled stunt with no prep . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't even think about the dreaded exam . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) brain simply spits out : 
I talked to a girl ! 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stands there , beaming like an idiot , until someone bumps into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoulder . 
`` Get moving , shitty Deku , '' they growl . 
It pulls him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) out of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) reverie ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) jumps at the sight of Kacchan 's red glare boring into him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) -- but is then subsequently confused when the_other_boy ($_Midoriya_Izuku) just keeps walking forward to the doors . 
No taunting . No teasing . Nothing . 
It 's true that Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) had been a lot more reserved following the ... incident . Whereas previous help from Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) spurred on relentless insults , this_time_Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) seemed recoil from any contact at all . Is he ($_this_time_Bakugou) ashamed ? Angry ? 
Either way , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds that the lack of attention -- positive or negative -- is off-putting . It feels like Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) is plotting something . 
-LRB- Or that Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) thinks he ($_this_time_Bakugou) 's plotting something . -RRB- 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries to wipe that unease from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mind , changing his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts to the task ahead . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sighs , then follows his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) neighbor through those daunting doors . 
They 're greeted by a towering stage , the seats layered around it packed and chatter bouncing off the walls . A quick pitstop at the check-in table and the bestowing of the testing pack and seating assignments for the info session , then the two deposit themselves in chairs further back than Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) would like . 
The silence from Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) is deafening ; they both quietly pin on their numbers and pull on their armbands , neither acknowledging the other 's presence . 
The air is thick with tension , awkward shifting in seats and nervous gazes drifting over the throng of other students as they all await the test instructions . Some stretch in place , some control their breathing , and some just sit and stare . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) in the last category , trying to push down the trembling in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stomach as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) watches the experienced motions and sculpted muscles of the others around him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
What was he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thinking ? He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) literally only learned how to earthbend -- what , ten months ago ? These kids have been bending their whole lives . Who was he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) to think that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) could waltz in as some amateur and actually procure himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) a spot in the top bending school in the city ? 
Stupid, stupid, stupid. 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nervously adjusts the green armband on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) forearm -- an earthbender . Just an earthbender . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to keep it that way . 
If people find out that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's the avatar , they also find out that All_Might ($_All_Might) is dead . The fragile peace that All_Might ($_All_Might) 's image has upheld since the rebellion collapses , and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's forced to deal with the aftermath -- untrained . Imagine the sheer panic that would arise when people found out their current avatar was n't even able to bend up until 10 months ago . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) might consider telling some of the Yuuei ($_Yuuei) staff if he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) actually gets in -- some of them might already know , even -- , but it 's essential that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) keep this secret until he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's mastered Earth at least . 
Of course , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to get into Yuuei ($_Yuuei) first . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts are interrupted when he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) notices what appears to be their instructor . 
A man in airbending reds and yellows takes to the stage , swaggering over to the podium and tapping at the mic a few times . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) glances at some papers laid out in front of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , then looks up at the crowd of students ahead . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) uses one hand to slick his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pointy yellow hair back , and the other to read whatever is written on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) notes . 
When he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's done , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks up , smiles , and then shouts . 
`` HOW 'S IT GOIN ' , PROSPECTIVE YUUEI STUDENTS ? '' 
The students all slam their hands over their ears , the mic turned up way too high for someone who is obviously naturally pretty loud . 
The_man ($_Midoriya_Izuku) glances at someone at the back of the stage , pulling his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mouth away from the mic . 
`` What -- you want me to ? '' He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gestures at the mic , then at himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . More gesticulating , then a look of understanding . `` Oh , you want me to not use the mic ? Okay , that 's cool . That 's fair . '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) steps away from the podium , then starts again . 
`` Sorry for that . Good morning , examinees ! I hope you 're ready to TEST ! '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya) gasps with recognition , clapping a hand over his ($_Midoriya) mouth . 
`` That 's -- that 's Yamada Hizashi ! Present Mic ! '' he ($_Midoriya) whispers excitedly . `` Bending match announcer and pro airbender for the -- '' 
`` Stop fangirling and fucking pay attention , dipshit , '' Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) growls . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shuts up instantly , but a smile still tugs at the corners of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mouth . 
`` Let 's get right to it ! As you all know , Yuuei ($_Yuuei) is a multi-disciplinary combat school with a focus on bending and fighting 's active use in careers , '' Yamada ($_Yamada) says , gesturing at the Jumbotron behind him ($_Yamada) as it blinks from the school logo to the number 2 . He ($_Yamada) , in turn , raises two fingers . `` That 's why we 'll be testing you on two different aspects : power and combat . '' 
# 1 , the jumbotron reads . Power . 
`` First , we have to gage how much power you can put into your bending , '' Yamada ($_Yamada) explains . `` We need to have you at a certain caliber of bending before we can do any work with you . Airbenders will go for speed , firebenders for distance and heat , waterbenders for distance , and earthbenders for height . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks down at the table in front of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . Yeah , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's been working on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) power output through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sessions with All_Might ($_All_Might) , but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is n't sure how that will stack up against the other benders here . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'll just have to do his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) best . 
`` Remember : power comes from many different sources in bending , '' Yamada ($_Yamada) says , almost as a side-note . `` There 's sheer power , there 's technical power -- we do n't care whichever one you use , as long as your output is good . '' 
# 2 : Combat . 
`` And here 's the fun part -- the combat , '' the_man ($_Midoriya_Izuku) says with a devious grin . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gulps . 
`` We have multiple bending rings set up , each with their own stationed team , '' Yamada ($_Yamada) says , waving a hand at an animated fighting ring behind him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . `` We 've assigned you into teams of four . Your task is simple : beat the other team . '' 
A murmur goes across the room , students glancing at one another . 
`` Now , just beating the other team is n't gon na be enough to pass , of course . We 're grading you on a multitude of other things . But I 'll tell you this : the more hits you get on the other team , the better . You do n't want to be a bystander for this test . '' 
`` You 'll get more info on the combat portion right before you fight , '' Yamada ($_Yamada) says . `` But for now : go show us some power ! '' 
His following wink rallies the students ; there 's a burst in noise from the crowd , with students vying to escape their seats and get to the testing sites first . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) follows hesitantly behind them , the reality of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) competition now dawning on him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
x
They 're broken into groups and taken down to different testing sites . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) are separated -LRB- thank god -RRB- , and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't bother mingling with the other examinees as they walk out onto the field -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't think his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stomach could take it . 
It 's a typical green field , but with a painted white line differentiating the testing zone from the observation zone . The students amass right on the line . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) edges his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) way to the front of the crowd , opting to fight his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nervousness by observing other students ' tests . As he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) waits for the test to begin , someone chimes right next to him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
`` You ($_Midoriya_Izuku) made it ! '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) left to see his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) savior from earlier : the airbending girl . Somehow , they ended up in the same testing group -- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is n't sure whether he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's happy or sad about that . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fidgets . 
`` U-uh . Yep ... '' 
She looks a little more serious from earlier , the smile she returns not making it all the way to her eyes . She must be nervous , too . 
`` Well , good luck ! '' Without another word , she goes back to watching the field . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is grateful for her not wanting to small-talk -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) would puke . 
The_proctor ($_the_proctor) makes his ($_the_proctor) way into the testing zone , scanning a clipboard . `` All right , '' he ($_the_proctor) begins . `` First , students here based on recommendation . Line up . '' 
A group of six students step forward , their only notable difference from the other examinees being a secondary golden arm band . 
They represent all four elements , but they all have an air of confidence around themselves -- majority of them are guaranteed a spot at the school , whether it be due to money , ability , or both . 
Whereas Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) had to fight just to stand at the starting line with everyone else , these people are already leagues ahead of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
Their following displays are appropriately fantastic : a girl launches a water whip at break-neck speeds , some boy forces a column of rock at least three stories high . 
But the test that catches everyone 's attention is a boy with strange white and red hair . 
As he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) takes to the field , something about him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) seems familiar -- his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hair ? The dignity he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) carries himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) with ? Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't see his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face , but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's seen this kid before . 
The_examinee ($_Midoriya_Izuku) seems to have tuned the rest of the world out . As soon as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's given the go ahead , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) swirls his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms in a loose circle , wrists twisting and elegantly pulling and pushing . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't help but be entranced by the display ; they 're the moves of an experienced waterbender , but something looks off -- instead of the calmness and patience of typical waterbending , the motions look borderline angry , fast and sometimes even jagged . 
The boy 's palms spark . 
With a sharp jump and thrust , a jet of flames erupts from his hands , leaving a charred line of grass half a football field long . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) flinches . 
His eyes finally drift down to the boy 's armband : red . Fire Nation . But what kind of bending was that ? It was more waterbending than firebending -- and in a test where you 're try to maximize power output , you definitely want to draw more on firebending technique . 
The boy looks unfazed , merely straightening up and relaxing with an indifferent expression . It 's not until he turns to face the rest of the group that Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) spots the mass of red puckered flesh on his left eye and things click together . 
A scar . Strangely colored hair . Calm , removed . Firebending that looks like waterbending . 
That 's ... . 
That 's ... . 
`` Hey , um , '' the airbender girl says from beside him . `` You 're kind of staring . At Todoroki Shouto . Y’ know . The Firelord 's son . The one that hates staring . '' 
At the sound of his name , the prince turns and locks eyes with him . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) snaps out of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) trance , jerking to attention and whipping his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head to the side in a TOTALLY subtle attempt to play it off . 
`` W-was I ? '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nervously asks , eyes jumping across the backs of other testers , at the buildings -- anywhere but Todoroki ($_Todoroki) . `` Haha , oops ... '' 
The girl starts laughing , to which a nearby boy almost immediately chimes in to tell her that laughing during an exam is disrespectful , and she ought to be ashamed , and if she aims to be a top bender , she should be paying extremely close attention , and a million other things that Midoriya tunes out . When he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gages it 's been long enough , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shyly peeks at the prince again . 
Todoroki ($_Todoroki) 's mismatched eyes are still trained on him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , the quiet intensity of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gaze making Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fidget . It feels like he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's being analyzed -- like this boy is sinking under his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) skin and paging through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) weaknesses and secrets . 
It 's scary . 
The prince finally looks away and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) releases a breath he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) did n't know he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) was holding . 
`` Can I go ? '' Todoroki ($_Todoroki) asks , turning to the test proctor . `` I ($_Todoroki) 've done my ($_Todoroki) required testing . '' 
`` I ($_Todoroki) 'm afraid not , Your Highness , '' the_proctor ($_the_proctor) says . `` You have to stay here until all examinees have finished the power gaging portion of the exam . I ($_the_proctor) 'm sorry for all the formalities , but -- well , rules are rules . '' 
Todoroki ($_Todoroki) sighs , then calmly moves his way off the testing lawn and into the crowd . He accidentally bumps into the next recommendee in line , a buzzcut-headed airbender , but does n't apologize and keeps moving . The airbender side-eyes him before stepping up to test . 
The prince looks robotic . Icy . Not anything like what would be expected of the Firelord 's son . 
What happened to him ? What must his home life be like , to make him that cold ? 
But Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is brought back to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) current predicament when the airbender spontaneously unleashes a tornado on the testing field , ripping up the grass and unrooting nearby bushes . Oh, right. He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to go up against that . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) twitches in place as the_proctor ($_the_proctor) tells the boy to contain the storm and go back into the crowd . 
`` That concludes the recommendee testing , '' the_proctor ($_the_proctor) says . `` Now we 'll move on to standard testing -- and I ($_the_proctor) must remind recommendees that they 're to stay put for this portion , as well . '' He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) glances at Todoroki , who has melted somewhere into the back of the crowd . 
`` Everyone , please section off into your respective elements . '' 
With a shy smile , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and the airbending girls part ways . The_proctor ($_the_proctor) announces the order of elements : water , earth , fire , air . 
The following displays are n't as intimidating as the recommendees ' , but they still put Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) on edge . The waterbenders move the water like extensions of their own bodies , nonchalantly blasting streams across the field . 
When they move onto earthbending , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) starts feeling intimidated . 
Yes , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has put on weight and packed on muscle . But he 's still a shrimp compared to some of the muscles he sees on his fellow earthbenders . Sculpted calves , broad backs , and flat pecs -- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels like he accidentally signed up for a bodybuilding show that he was horribly unprepared for . 
But All_Might ($_All_Might) 's advice comes to mind . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , there 's a misconception about earthbending that you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 're fixated on , he remembers All Might telling him one session when he was getting particularly frustrated with the move . 
Know this : muscle mass does not equate to power . 
No , power in bending comes from the strength of your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) own internal energy -- your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) body must be able to hold that power , of course , but your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) main focus should be keeping that energy strong and pure when you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) push it into the elements . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) breathes deeply . Focus on himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . Focus on doing the move right . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) almost does n't notice the test in front of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has finished . 
The_proctor ($_the_proctor) pauses for a moment before reading the next name . 
`` Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) Izuku . '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) jumps at the sound of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) name , then begins to edge his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) way through the crowd with slumped shoulders . 
The prolonged look the_proctor ($_the_proctor) gives him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels too significant to ignore -- does he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows ? Does everyone in Yuuei know ? He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) swallows hard , then assumes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) power stance . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gazes down at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands , trying to calm his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) heartbeat and praying he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's not about to do something that is n't earthbending . 
`` Whenever you 're ready , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , '' the_proctor ($_the_proctor) says , making the boy flinch . 
Okay , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) : remember your training . You worked with All_Might ($_All_Might) on this -- you should have this in the bag . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shifts , steadying his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feet and shifting his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) weight into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) heels . This is the easy part . 
A deep breath . 
Then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begins . 
The move is awkward and more handsy than normal earthbending -- in a slow and deliberate movement , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) moves his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms upwards from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) core and out in a circle . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands meet at the top ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) calmly lowers them , clasped over his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) heart . 
Draw power from your core , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hears All Might say . Bring your heart 's energy into your hands , then out through your feet and into the ground . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) imagines that energy transfer , sees his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) power bleed out of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chest and into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands . 
Down and steady , my boy . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands move lower towards the ground , dragging the energy into the earth below . 
And… Now! 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thrusts his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands skyward in a singular decisive movement , the ground following the motion . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) holds it , waits for the rumbling above to halt . And then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) breaks stance , oddly drained after the display . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) cranes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head upwards , panting . It rivals the earthbending he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's seen thus far -- it might even be higher . 
But the important thing is that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) actually did it . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) actually correctly did the move All_Might ($_All_Might) taught him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) exits the bending zone with a small smile on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face , bubbling with internal pride . It makes him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feel slightly better about the next portion of the exam -- at least he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) performed well on one half of the practical . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) settles into the crowd , content to silently watch the next bending feats . 
“Hey.” 
It 's a hollow voice , cool and controlled . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) turns to look at the speaker , ready to greet them in turn . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) flinches when he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sees it 's none other than the Fire Nation Prince , Todoroki_Shouto ($_Todoroki_Shouto) . 
-LRB- Is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) supposed to bow ? Prostrate on the floor and kiss his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoes ? Oh god what is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) supposed to do . -RRB- 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) instead opts to blink at the other boy , lost for words . Todoroki ($_Todoroki) must be used to awed silence -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) speaks in Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's stead . 
`` That was an All Might specialty move , '' the prince states , unwavering . 
“Um. Y-yes ? '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) says . 
Todoroki ($_Todoroki) does nothing but continue to stare and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mentally slaps himself for forgetting . 
`` Oh god , I mean -- yes , Your Highness , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) backtracks , face suddenly hot and palms uncomfortably sweaty . `` I admired -- '' 
`` Do n't call me that , '' Todoroki ($_Todoroki) objects . “Please. I ca n't stand it when people associate me with my jerk of a father . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) reels at the nonchalant insult -- of course , there were rumors that the heir did n't get along with the_Firelord ($_the_Firelord) , but to be so open about it ($_the_Firelord) ... . 
Todoroki_Shouto ($_Todoroki_Shouto) must truly not care about family image . 
“Okay…. Todoroki ($_Todoroki) , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stammers . `` But , um , yes , I admired All_Might ($_All_Might) a lot as a kid , and I picked up a lot of his bending tricks from watching his matches . '' 
`` That one stunt combines aspects of firebending with a basic earthbending move in order to amplify power output , '' Todoroki ($_Todoroki) says without missing a beat . `` It 's supposed to take years to master -- they say you can only learn it at Yuuei or from All Might himself . '' 
Is it hot out here ? Or is it just Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ? God , it 's boiling . 
Haha , I 'm so dead . 
`` I. Well . Hm , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stammers , pulling at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) collar and cringing under Todoroki ($_Todoroki) 's steady gaze . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) guess ... I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'm just a quick learner ? '' 
Todoroki ($_Todoroki) does n't move and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's eyes flick around the surrounding crowd , desperately avoiding eye contact . The sensation of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) skin being peeled back by the prince 's gaze has now amplified into the feeling of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) skin being flayed . It takes all of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) willpower to avoid scampering off . 
`` ... Sure , '' Todoroki ($_Todoroki) says finally in the voice of someone utterly unconvinced . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) scans Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) one more time , then turns without comment and walks back into the crowd . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) resists the urge to start hyperventilating . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gets the sense that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) just had a very close call , even though there 's no way in hell that Todoroki ($_Todoroki) could have known anything about some common Earth Kingdom kid like him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . It was the sheer speculative power of the prince alone that nearly blew his cover -- that , and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's horrendous ability to keep secrets . 
If he actually gets into Yuuei ($_Yuuei) , he 'll have to watch himself around the heir . 
He watches the rest of the examinees in a daze . It 's one amazing performance after the next -- they blend together in his mind and he finds himself both intimidated and inspired . 
This is what he could be if he gets into Yuuei ($_Yuuei) . 
This is the power he could practice beside , the people he could befriend . 
-LRB- He tries to ignore the sensation of mismatched , suspicious eyes attached to his back . -RRB- 
When the final test is complete , the_proctor ($_the_proctor) calls for them to gather into their respective elemental groups and to head inside -- further instructions will be provided there . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) leaves the field , a sense of foreboding lodging itself in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stomach . 
x
When he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds out the second portion of the match involves them wearing pro-bending uniforms , it 's simultaneously a nightmare and a dream-come-true . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stands in front of the strewn out clothes , knowing he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to dress fast but taking his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) time regardless . How many times has he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wanted to do this ? To wear these uniforms , to fight in the pro-bending ring ? 
But he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't get any pleasure from it right now -- the stakes are too high . 
The rules of the match echo through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pulls off his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) own sweats and picks up the black shirt and pants . 
`` This wo n't be your normal pro-bending match , with rounds and territory gains , '' Yamada shares , seated backwards in a chair in the small classroom . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks far too casual for something that will make or break Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's future . 
`` Instead , it 's one 5-minute round , with your sole objective being to push the other team off the back . '' 
The padded underclothes are tight and restrictive ; Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) yanks them on and wishes he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) had asked for a size up . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's grown more than he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thought he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) had . 
`` The bare minimum to pass is KO'ing the other team . Individual scoring is based on how many hits on your opponents you each make . '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shrugs the thick padding on over his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoulders , yanks the green sash around his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) waist tighter , and deposits the helmet on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) exits the room , swerving a left and going to the entry hall . 
`` You 'll want to keep as many of your teammates in the ring as you can , while also getting in as many hits on the enemy as possible . '' 
The lights of the arena are blinding ; he ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) squints as he ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) stumbles his ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) way into the ring . He ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) pays no mind to his ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) teammates , solely focused on calming himself ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) down before the match . 
`` If you fall out of the ring , you fail . '' 
He ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) closes his ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) eyes and inhales deeply . This is it . 
Some voice in the back of his ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) head prompts him ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) to wonder how Bakugou ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) is faring in all of this -- but considering this is Bakugou_he_'s_thinking_about ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) he ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) 's thinking about , there 's no reason to be worried . 
He ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) needs to focus on himself ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) . 
“Hi again!” 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) jumps at the cheery voice interrupting his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts , then flushes when he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) spots the speaker : pixie bob girl . 
`` Looks like we 're on the same team , huh ? '' she notes , eyes skimming over Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , then the other two team members behind him ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) . `` The other two do n't seem to be terribly friendly . The waterbender glared at me when I tried to talk to him ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) and the firebender was a little zoned out . I do n't think they 're into the whole teamwork thing , y’ know ? '' 
`` Uh-huyeah , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) says , internally slapping himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) for the mix of gibberish he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't help but spew . 
Luckily , the girl does n't seem to mind . Maybe she 's used to it . `` Oh well , I guess we 'll just have to watch each others ' backs . I 'm Uraraka ($_Uraraka) , by the way ! '' 
Uraraka ($_Uraraka) : bright , beautiful . How fitting. 
`` M-Midoriya , '' he ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) replies . 
`` Nice to meet ya , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ! '' She drops her helmet on her head , gives him ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) a final smile and thumbs up , then paces ahead of him ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) to the middle line . 
Well , at least that 's one advantage . Uraraka ($_Uraraka) seems to be a pretty experienced bender -- even if airbending is n't terribly offensive , she 'll still cover for him ($_Uraraka) . 
It 's a small comfort but a comfort nonetheless ; he ($_Uraraka) joins his ($_Uraraka) team at the start point . 
The following information the referee spits out sound like meaningless garble in his ears . Not that it matters -- he already knows the rules by heart . Instead , he takes the time to focus himself , to peek glances at his opponents and teammates . 
The other team is just as terrifying as he anticipated . He 's not sure if they 're Yuuei students or hired benders , but they 're older and hardened . They look sure of themselves and their bending , and face the prospective students with countenances of grim determination . 
His team is ... not quite so confident . Like Uraraka ($_Uraraka) said , the firebender looks dazed and confused . The waterbender looks near murderous . 
But the face that scares him the most is Uraraka ($_Uraraka) 's . Gone is her ($_Uraraka) cheery disposition and airy smile ; instead , all he sees is icy willpower . Her ($_Uraraka) eyes pick apart the other team as well , dancing over their arms and legs and gauging their faces . 
This girl means business . 
Rather than put him at ease , it disorients him further -- he 's not the only one desperate to get in here . Is sabotage an option in this match ? What if she ($_Uraraka) steals points from him ? 
Quit it , quit it , quit it ! He scolds himself internally , too lost in thought to notice the teams slowly edging towards their back boundaries and the ref raising a pointed hand . 
There 's literally no logic in Uraraka ($_Uraraka) trying to beat you ! You 're on the same team , you both have to survive ! Regardless , you 'll get enough points anyway , you 've done the work and -- 
`` -- riya ! '' 
He startles , whipping around to see Uraraka ($_Uraraka) shouting at him . 
`` They 're about to start ! '' 
He stumbles into Zone_1 ($_Zone_1) and tries to sink into fighting position when a sharp voice booms overhead . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks upwards , pupils shrinking in shock . 
`` ... 2 , 1 : GO . '' 
He does n't even have time to blink before something solid thumps into his stomach , sending him tumbling backwards and into Zone_2 ($_Zone_2) . He wheezes a curse under his breath and then hauls himself to his feet , scanning the scene ahead . 
The match can only have been going on for ten seconds , but it 's already sheer chaos . The arena is a multitude of one-on-one battles : his waterbender is trying to get a blow on the opposing airbender , their firebender is being relentlessly pelted with stone disks -- she 's already in Zone 3 , yikes -- , and Uraraka ($_Uraraka) is cartwheeling across Zone_1 ($_Zone_1) to avoid fire blasts . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) raises a disk and angles it to hit the enemy earthbender , but then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) realizes . 
Wait. 
... Where 's their waterbender ? 
The answer comes with a jet of water to the stomach . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lands on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) butt but then uses his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ground contact to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) advantage , shooting out energy through the floor and calling for a nearby stone disk . The disk soars to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands , which he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) then wields as a makeshift shield against the water strikes . The gaping hole in the middle means it does n't offer as much protection as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'd like , but it 's all that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's got . 
The blasts come in one-second intervals and with all the force of a train ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) peeks from around the side of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) blockade to see the waterbender , at the edge of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) Zone 1 and with firmly planted feet . 
Okay -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to somehow distract the waterbender to keep from getting blasted , then aim a disk at him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) to score a point . But how? 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes leap across the field , settling on the duel between his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) team 's waterbender and the enemy airbender . That fight is almost over -- one more hit on the airbender and she 'll be off the back . 
Time for a risk . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) waits for a water-free moment , then flings his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shield as hard as possible at the airbender . 
It does n't connect , but it disorients her ; taking advantage of the distraction , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) team 's waterbender propels a column of water towards the enemy that hits her dead-on . She soars to the back of the arena and over the edge . 
Nice. One enemy down and one teammate free to assist . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gets pelted with water again -- but with nothing free to block it , the force pushes him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) uncomfortably close to the Zone 3 line . Gritting his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) teeth , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) leans into the stream so he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands and knees . 
As soon as the water lets up , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) leaps upright , stomping the ground and summoning another disk from the ground . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'll have to make this fast . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) keeps up the disk 's momentum with his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms , flinging the rock and his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) energy directly at the waterbender , poised for a direct hit and his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) first point -- 
Water makes it to the enemy first , slamming into him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and pushing him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) into Zone_2 ($_Zone_2) . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's disk whizzes overhead and out of the ring . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) drops his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms and cranes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head to look at the water 's source . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) teammate , wheeling his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms and prepping another water blast , does n't even look at him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoots the enemy waterbender off the back and out of the ring . So much for teamwork . 
-LRB- They only have two enemies left now , but Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't be happy about it . -RRB- 
A glance at the clock : 2 minutes left . 
Holy crap , only two minutes left already ? He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) still does n't have any points ! Who’s even left to hit? 
Their firebender must have been knocked out -- she 's nowhere to be seen . But the odds are still in their favor : three versus two . 
Uraraka ($_Uraraka) is now engaged with the earthbender -- she 's struggling , but she 's staying put in Zone_1 ($_Zone_1) . The firebender stands in the middle of Zone_2 ($_Zone_2) , looking to pick a fight . 
Okay , there 's Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's target . 
The firebender , however , notices him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) first : she volleys off a round of fireballs right at him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's forced to roll to the side . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pushes onto his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feet and breaks into a run when the fire keeps coming . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's only done defense so far -- but what else can he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) do ? How can he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fight when the_enemy ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wo n't even let him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) plant himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and utilize his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bending ? 
Nearing the edge of the Zone 2 and Uraraka ($_Uraraka) 's fight , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has no choice but to turn around and backtrack -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's going to get hit . 
Unless he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gets a distraction ... . 
“Uraraka!” Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shouts , praying that she 'll be able to spare a moment . `` Some air , please ! '' 
She jerks at her name , looking towards Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and narrowly sidestepping an oncoming earth disk from her opponent . Her gaze jumps over his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fight , and then a spark of understanding leaps into her eyes . She nods . 
Whole arms twisting in a full-body circle , she inhales deeply and holds . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shifts his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) core to head back in the direction he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) came from . 
Uraraka ($_Uraraka) exhales and hell breaks loose . 
Something resembling a tornado erupts from her , spiraling towards the enemy firebender and redirecting her fireballs into a now fiery vortex . Eyes wide under her helmet , the opponent runs into Zone_3 ($_Zone_3) to dodge it ($_Zone_3) . 
Now! Now Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can go for the hit . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) plants himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , raising a disk . 
But before he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can even aim it ($_Zone_3) , the wind catches up to the firebender . She soars upwards , then off the edge and into the watery pit below along with the tornado . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stares , desperation clawing at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) core . 
`` One hit ! '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) cries in frustration . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) just need one hit ! '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks dully at the scene ahead -- there 's just one more person to score hits on , and Uraraka ($_Uraraka) seems to have that fight on lock . Or maybe the waterbender will try to snatch points from him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) again , if he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's still here . 
Turning around , however , the waterbender is nowhere to be found . It looks like it 's just him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and Uraraka ($_Uraraka) . But she 's more than capable -- if he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tried to interfere , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'd probably just mess her up . 
There 's a dull thud and someone yelps . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) whips around to see Uraraka ($_Uraraka) pinned under an earth disk , the opposing team 's earthbender stalking over . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gives a harsh stomp and a disk slides under his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) captive , the sharp motion making her wheeze . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's eyes flit over to the clock : 30 seconds . 30 seconds until they win . 
However , if Uraraka ($_Uraraka) gets knocked out of the ring and it 's just him ($_Uraraka) and this other guy left ... Then they have to face off in a tiebreaker . 
Which , yes , is an opportunity for actual points , if Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wins . 
But it also means that Uraraka ($_Uraraka) fails . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thrusts his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands upwards and raises a disk from the ground . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) repeats the motion again , and again , and again until he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has a 10-foot stack of disks hovering directly in front of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) grunts under the strain , legs screaming in protest , but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) manages to stay upright . 
Meanwhile , the_enemy ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is in position , arms pushing out from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) body in a fluid gesture and sending Uraraka ($_Uraraka) 's rock coffin hurtling towards the edge -- 
With a guttural yell , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) slams both his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fists into the side of the stack and sends it flying at the opponent . The guy looks up in time for it to pummel into him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , rocketing him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) away from Uraraka ($_Uraraka) and towards the opposite edge . 
The impact from the blow sends a shudder up both of Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's arms and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) swears he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can feel them fracture in at least five different places . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms become pure , unadulterated pain . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) collapses . 
Everything seems hazy as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) watches his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) missile erupt into a billowing cloud of dust , watches the_enemy ($_Midoriya_Izuku) emerge dirty but unscathed . The_man ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lifts his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels a disk slide under him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and two disks rise to box him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) in on both sides , sending a new wave of searing heat through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't move . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) surroundings are shifting ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's speeding towards the edge and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's accepted that there 's nothing he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can do , that his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) exam is over . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) clears the side and hangs in the great open space , right before that 20 foot plunge into icy water below -- 
But gravity never kicks in . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) simply floats there , 20 feet above failure . And then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) realizes . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lolls his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head to the side and spots Uraraka ($_Uraraka) , lower half still trapped in earth disks but right wrist frantically twisting to keep him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) up . The earthbender is nowhere to be seen . 
She adds her left arm to the movement , circling her hands over each other and towards herself , and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begin to drift back . 
When the ground is finally below him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , Uraraka ($_Uraraka) stops bending . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) drops the 3 feet to the floor and gives a weak croak of protest on impact . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes drift to the clock in time to see big flashing zeroes -- 
`` Aaaaaand your exam is over ! '' Yamada yells over the intercom . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) blinks . 
All that training . All that work . And:
`` I got one hit . Just one hit , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) moans , dropping his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head to the ground . `` What kind of a bender am I ... '' 
There 's something wet on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) cheek and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) closes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes , trying to tune out the irrepressible pain shooting up his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms . It seeps into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) brain , clouding his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts , and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fights to stay awake . 
`` ... him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) to the healers , now ! '' 
One hit . 
`` ... what was that stunt ... '' 
One hit . 
`` ... sure she 's okay , get her a bag ... . '' 
One hit . 
The acrid smell of vomit reaches his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nose and everything is overwhelming -- the noises are overwhelming and his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts are overwhelming and the pain is overwhelming . 
`` ... he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's repeating one hit , why ... . '' 
I failed . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) brain flickers off . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't eat much those next few days . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms are healed , layers of bandages and worried looks from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mother the only evidence that anything happened . 
But the events of the exam plague his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mind , looping over and over as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries to settle back into normalcy , as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries to come to terms with what just happened and what to do next . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's not going to Yuuei . That much seems obvious . 
Sure , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stayed in the ring -- but no way that was enough to get him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) into the school , not when others were scoring hits by the hundreds . 
Bakugou ($_Bakugou) got in -- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't have to speculate on that . He ($_Bakugou) 's dreading seeing the smug look on his ($_Bakugou) face in class the day after they find out , feels nauseous thinking about facing the class when they knew what would happen the whole time . 
Maybe Uraraka ($_Uraraka) got in . Maybe she 'll remember that silly earthbending kid that could n't even score a hit , take pity and call to hang out sometime . Maybe some good will actually come out of the exam . 
He ($_Bakugou) sits on the couch , squeezing a weight in his ($_Bakugou) fist and evaluating other schools to look into , other masters he ($_Bakugou) can learn from . 
But it feels wrong -- it feels like he ($_Bakugou) should be following in All Might 's steps and learning at Yuuei ($_Yuuei) . 
How is he ($_Bakugou) supposed to be great if he ($_Bakugou) is n't learning from the greats ? What important friendships would he ($_Bakugou) have made with the four nation 's up and coming leaders -- like the_Fire_Nation_heir ($_Bakugou) ? How much easier would the path ahead have been , had he ($_Bakugou) made those connections early ? 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thinks of Todoroki 's empty , calculating eyes and shudders . 
True , the_prince ($_Bakugou) did n't seem so easy to befriend . But being classmates at Yuuei ($_Yuuei) would have been a good start . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is trapped in a cycle of misery -- thinking of all that could have been and all that would never be . His ($_Bakugou) mother , the saint that she is , has allowed him ($_Bakugou) to mope for the week , only prompting him ($_Bakugou) to eat and go to school . But otherwise , she 's let him ($_Bakugou) be . She saw it coming and understands that he ($_Bakugou) needs time to come to terms . 
He ($_Bakugou) does n't respond when his ($_Bakugou) mom announces she 's going downstairs to grab the mail . But when he ($_Bakugou) hears the thud of feet running up the stairs , he ($_Bakugou) knows . 
`` I-Izuku ! '' His ($_Bakugou) mom cries , crashing into the living room and presenting him ($_Bakugou) a simple envelope . The Yuuei seal glistens on the front . `` It 's here ! '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) simply stares at the black lettering for a moment . 
Then he ($_Bakugou) silently rises from the couch , taking the letter from her hand and walking to his ($_Bakugou) room . The door closes behind him ($_Bakugou) with a resolute click and he ($_Bakugou) takes a deep breath . 
Welp , this is it . 
Here is the confirmation that he ($_Bakugou) needs a new plan . 
He ($_Bakugou) sits at his ($_Bakugou) desk , fingers hesitating at the seal . But impatience and curiosity soon overtake his ($_Bakugou) fears and he ($_Bakugou) rips it open , pulling the folded paper from inside and flattening it out . He ($_Bakugou) hungrily begins to read . 
`` Midoriya_Izuku ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , '' it ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begins , not sparing even a moment for pleasantries . `` The following letter encloses the results of your entrance exam to Yuuei Bending Academy . '' 
Below the sentence is a chart . Column one : Written Exam . Column two : Power output . Column three : Combat score . 
The written exam is what he ($_Bakugou) expected : he ($_Bakugou) passed . Not with flying colors , but with a sizeable margin . 
The power score is actually better than he ($_Bakugou) expected . 27 feet , a solid 10 feet above the average earthbending score . 
But the combat column is where he ($_Bakugou) trembles . The `` 1 '' draws his ($_Bakugou) eyes in like a magnet , confirming his ($_Bakugou) fears . 
He ($_Bakugou) did n't score nearly high enough to get in . 
He ($_Bakugou) 's toast . 
Resigned , he ($_Bakugou) lets his ($_Bakugou) eyes drift down to the sentence directly following the chart . 
`` Welcome to Yuuei . '' 
His ($_Bakugou) eyes skim over the words , then he ($_Bakugou) double-takes . He ($_Bakugou) backtracks and reads it again . 
It stays the same : `` Welcome to Yuuei . '' 
This has to be some sort of mistake . He ($_Bakugou) has to call them , to tell them they sent him ($_Bakugou) the wrong letter . 
He ($_Bakugou) skims the sentences below that , trying to gauge who the letter was actually meant for . The special observations section catches his ($_Bakugou) eye . 
`` Note that another examinee on your combat team expressed a wish to share hit points with you ; this tells us you are cooperative and show a good temperament for collaboration . '' 
Uraraka -- it has to be Uraraka . She wanted to share points with me ? 
`` While lacking in the hits category in combat , you made up for those lost points in the teamwork/rescue portion of the test . Your teachers will work with you on your offense , but you demonstrate promise in rescue fields or teamwork-oriented bending jobs . '' 
... Teamwork and cooperation ? 
His gaze leaps back up to the chart , honing in on a subsection he missed beforehand : rescue points . The whopping `` 59 '' under it sharply contrasts the `` 1 '' in the hits category . 
It 's not a mistake . 
He ... 
He actually got into Yuuei . 
A drop of water lands on the letter and blurs some of its ink , but Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds that he does n't care . It 's not until he starts crying in earnest that his mom worriedly raps on the door and asks to come in . 
Of course his first instinct is to tell All_Might ($_All_Might) . 
The former avatar probably already knows , what with their spiritual connection and his worldly contacts . But Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wants to tell him in person regardless , to thank him for the help and to maybe get some advice on how to proceed . 
He 'll admit -- All_Might ($_All_Might) does n't seem so godlike anymore . If anything , he 's a source of comfort , a pillar of stability and of common experience that Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lacks in the waking world . 
-LRB- Maybe All_Might ($_All_Might) is coming to feel less like something divine and more like family . -RRB- 
When Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) clambers into bed that night , he knows what to do . With his headphones playing a soft song for him , he lays flat on his back , gaze directed upwards towards the ceiling , and closes his eyes . 
He forces his heart to slow , makes himself ease his breathing and focus on the melody leaking into his ears . Breathe in, breathe out. His limbs melt into his bed . 
The music from his headphones gives way to a more all-encompassing hum -- the thrumming of the cosmos , of energy and space . He latches on , sees himself grab a fistful of that energy and watches it drag him into the unknown . 
When he opens his eyes again , he 's not in his familiar forest . 
It 's the Spirit World -- that much Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can tell -- , but it 's nothing like the tranquility of the towering trees he 's grown to know . 
The landscape is best described as a desert -- but rather than sand , it 's covered in dust . A barren horizon : no plants , no buildings , no people . Everything looks gray and dead . The air is dry and scratchy , and every breath feels like an assault on his throat . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) crouches to the ground , sifting a handful of the material through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fingers . It feels wrong . Something twinges in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chest and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't say why , but something in the dust feels ... alive ? Tormented ? 
Is there someone buried here ? Was this dust formerly someone ? 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begins to dig in haste -- looking for what , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't know . But if someone is in trouble , if someone is in pain , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to help , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't just leave them -- 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hand brushes something solid and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) halts for a moment . Then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) starts again in earnest , frantically clawing at the dust . The thing begins to surface and , to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) horror , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) realizes that it 's a hand . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) falls backwards on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) butt , scooching away from the object . But it 's too late -- the hand shifts , free from its confinement , and spiders its way out of its dusty prison . 
Several things happen at once . 
The formerly stagnant air whips itself into a frenzy . Dust takes to the air , pelting Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) in sheets , invading his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) clothes , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) throat . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chokes -- more accurately , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) drowns . 
The hand closes the gap , crawling over his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) foot and clamping onto his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ankle . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wastes air and yelps , flailing his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) leg around desperately in an attempt to get it off . But his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) energy wanes ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sinks , head hitting the ground . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can only watch the thing with his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes , unable to escape . 
It might just be oxygen deprivation -- but Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's blurring vision witnesses the dust by the hand swirl and combine into a crude attempt at a human body . 
The mass climbs its way up his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) unmoving torso , crushing the remaining air in him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) even faster than before . Its rough head settles right over Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries to jerk his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face away but finds that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't . 
I know what you are , the words come , snake-like and tired and cold . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's eyes widen ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) reaches at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) last scraps of energy and renews his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) efforts to pull away . Instead , a dusty hand clamps down over his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) throat . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lets out a weak wheeze of agony . 
The thing leans in , almost brushing Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's nose . And then it laughs -- a nasally wheezing noise , a sad mockery of actual laughter . It sends a chill down Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's spine . 
It belts out one more raspy chuckle . If it had a mouth , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) imagines it would be smiling . 
You think you 're safe ? That the world is safe ? it questions , a note of cruelty tinting its voice . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's head lulls , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyelids drooping shut and the tension draining from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) body . 
How naive. 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes are closed and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's barely conscious but the next words are painfully clear . 
You obviously have no idea what 's coming . 
Something wraps firm arms under Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's armpits , yanking him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) under the mound of dust and into the earth . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) swallows dust and sees no more . 
x
A shriek rips its way out of Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's throat as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bolts upright . 
Escape . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to escape . 
There 's something confining his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) legs -- 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) kicks his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) way out from under his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sheets , stumbling from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bed and tripping onto the floor . 
The soft carpeting of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) room . Gentle moonlight trickling in from shuttered windows . Rectangles of bending idols watching over him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) from the walls . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's in the real world . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's safe . 
Muffled footsteps scramble down the hall and his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mother rips open the door , hair ruffled and terror on her face . 
“Izuku! What happened?” 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't help it . A tiny sob fights its way out of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chest , then another . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's cried in front of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mom before . This ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is n't new . 
But it ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels different -- it ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's embarrassing . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's supposed to hold up the whole world but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't even hold himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) together . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) drops his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mom pauses in the doorway , assessing the scene . Then , no questions asked , she glides over and sinks to the floor , wrapping her arms around him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) in a comforting embrace . 
`` There there , Izuku , '' she murmurs , a hand rubbing up and down his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) back . `` It 'll all be okay . You 'll be fine . '' 
But it wo n't . And he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wo n't . 
How is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) supposed to go back to_the_Spirit_World ($_to_the_Spirit_World) after that ? 
How is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) supposed to talk to All Might with that thing there ? 
What is that thing ? What is it plotting ? 
How is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) supposed to stop it ? 
In an instant , the weight of the world comes plummeting onto his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) back and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) collapses under it , clinging to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mother and soaking her unknowing shoulders in the tears of a boy who was still precisely that : 
A boy . 
A second trip to the local healing clinic -LRB- a hairline fracture -- easily fixed -RRB- and an awkward explanation to his mom later , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is back at home and condemned from leaving the house -- regardless of whether or not he wants to test out his new abilities . 
But despite the house arrest , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't help but smile . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mom seems pretty excited , too -- she witnessed his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) rock firsthand , and although she ca n't entirely grasp how it took Izuku ($_Izuku) fourteen years to figure out bending , she 's ecstatic for her son . 
She bustles around the house , pulling out ingredients from the pantry and trying to tap at her phone at the same time . 
`` Oh , I 'm so excited for you , Izuku ($_Izuku) ! Earthbending! Can you believe it ? I 'm going to make you a cake . And I 'll call your father -- oh ! He 'll be so surprised ! He might want to come back in when he has a free day to say congrats -- '' 
`` Mom . Mom -- thank you . I 'm happy you 're excited , too , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) interrupts , walking over and leaning on the kitchen counter . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) smiles warmly . `` But seriously , you do n't have to make me ($_Midoriya_Izuku) a cake . I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) kind of just want to go to bed right now , I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'm beat . '' 
She blinks , then beams back at him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . `` Oh , of course ! It 's been quite the day for you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) -- I should have figured you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'd want to sleep . '' 
She places her phone and rolling pin on the counter , shuffling over to her son . Standing on tiptoes , she deposits a kiss on Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's forehead . 
`` I 'm very proud of you , '' she says softly . `` You never gave up , did you ? '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) smiles , then shakes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head slowly . She holds his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoulders , tears beading at the corners of her eyes . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) kisses her forehead in turn , then pulling away to walk towards his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bedroom . 
`` Night , Mom . '' 
`` Goodnight , Izuku ($_Izuku) . '' 
The door closes behind him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) plops onto his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bed , dwelling on what a day it 's been . 
How could his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) life have changed so much in 24 hours ? How could he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) have gone from a non-bending nobody to the avatar ? 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) flops backwards , and then the overwhelming nature of what comes next hits him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to go back to the Spirit World to talk to All Might and figure out his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) plan , pronto . 
The only method he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows of is sleep -- when he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) falls asleep , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) should be able to go there . 
So he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lays on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bed , staring blankly at the ceiling . 
This should be easy -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's supposedly the bridge between the human world and the Spirit World , so he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) should be able to cross over with no problem . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) just needs to focus , to try to meditate and cross that chasm . 
But as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gazes upwards and tries to clear his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts , muffled worries cloud his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mind . 
Why was n't I able to bend up until now ? What 's wrong with me ? 
Who do I talk to ? I do n't know what to do and I ca n't contact my only source of advice . 
What if I ca n't get into Yuuei ? How will I master bending if I do n't go there -- will I have to leave home ? Without telling my mom ? 
The_Spirit_World ($_The_Spirit_World) slips from his ($_The_Spirit_World) grasp and he ($_The_Spirit_World) shifts to his ($_The_Spirit_World) side with a weary sigh , resigning himself ($_The_Spirit_World) to a restless sleep . 
x
There 's no school the next day and his ($_The_Spirit_World) mom leaves the house telling him ($_The_Spirit_World) to stay put and rest -- but the second she closes the door behind her , he ($_The_Spirit_World) pulls on a jacket and slides on his ($_The_Spirit_World) shoes . 
He ($_The_Spirit_World) 's not well , but he ($_The_Spirit_World) ca n't rest easy until he ($_The_Spirit_World) knows the full extent of his ($_The_Spirit_World) bending abilities . He ($_The_Spirit_World) has to see if he ($_The_Spirit_World) can bend more than just earth and air . 
Past the back lot and under the cover of trees , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) comes to a stop . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head still has that cotton feeling that dulls his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) senses slightly , but overall he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels much more focused and refreshed . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) uncaps a waterbottle and places it on the ground , then goes to stand five feet away . 
First up : waterbending . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mimics the movements he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sees all the time on TV -- the back and forth , the pushing and pulling , the fluid arm circles . 
But the movements are too smooth , too gentle -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't figure out how to transfer his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) energy into the water without the powerful and decisive motions of earthbending . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries for a couple more minutes , then drops the positioning with a sigh . 
Okay , now for the one he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has even less hope with : firebending . 
It 's the same deal as waterbending ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) goes through the pro motions , sharp jabs and thrusts . But the sheer emotion equated with firebending , the power that those benders display -- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't tap into it . 
Sure , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's got fight in him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
But he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't seem to draw it out in the form of fire . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) treks back home , disappointed but not surprised . 
All that 's left to do now is to try to talk to All Might and get some answers . 
x
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries for a week : meditating , deep breathing , music . Anything to relax and help him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) cross over . 
But nothing works . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) always begins to think of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) troubles , to worry about the path ahead . 
It 's a cycle -- his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) anxiety means he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't make it to the Spirit World , but not getting to the Spirit World is causing him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) even more anxiety . It 's excessively stupid and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to calm down , to let his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) worries go . 
But he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't . That 's not in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nature . 
It 's after another failed attempt that Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hoists himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , blurry-eyed , from the bed . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) goes to sit at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) desk , head in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands , staring at the wood grain below . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's beginning to wonder if that whole thing with All_Might ($_All_Might) was a fever dream , that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's the avatar but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) never actually had that discussion with his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) predecessor . 
Why is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) so bad at this ? Was n't this supposed to come naturally ? 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stares at the desk for another second , then raises his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head . Reaching for his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) laptop , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) flips it open and frantically types . 
avatar life biographies 
It 's a dumb Google search , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows . But he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to know that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's not alone , that what he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's going through is normal . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) clicks the first link and begins to read . 
An airbending avatar , 10 lifetimes back , that did n't master all the elements until she was 36 . A firebending avatar , 3 lifetimes ago , that struggled consistently with going into the Avatar State . Another earthbender , 8 lifetimes past , that avoided all other kinds of bending , finding them foreign and difficult . 
The story that comforts him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) the most is All_Might ($_All_Might) 's . 
`` Avatar_Toshinori ($_Avatar_Toshinori) was reportedly unable to visit the_Spirit_World ($_to_the_Spirit_World) until he ($_Avatar_Toshinori) was eighteen , '' the article reads . `` When asked about the most difficult part of his ($_Avatar_Toshinori) journey to become a fully-realized avatar , he ($_Avatar_Toshinori) responded with : ` the spiritual aspect . ''' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stares at the words , a faint smile creeping on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's not alone . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's never been alone . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) struggle has been going on for centuries , and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's far from the first avatar to not know what to do . 
Even when a deep tiredness settles into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bones , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) continues to scroll through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) past lives . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels connected . 
When he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begins to doze off , cheek on the desk and eyes still on the computer , there 's something like a humming that leaks into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ears . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lets his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes sink shut , and the humming overtakes him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , filling his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ears and sinking into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) limbs . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lets it engulf him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
x
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can sense the difference before his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes even flick open . 
The air around him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels lighter , the ache of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) limbs fading and the weight of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyelids lessening . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) blinks , taking in the familiar clearing and lush greenery . But a quick survey shows that the former avatar is nowhere to be seen . 
A sense of panic settles in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) core . 
`` All_Might ($_All_Might) ? '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) questions quietly . Only silence greets him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . Then it hits him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
It 's just silence -- no noise from the babbling stream or the insects from within the trees , like last time . Simply eerie quietness , thick and foreboding . 
Something 's wrong . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) whips around , suddenly growing paranoid that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's being watched . The landscape seems to darken , the shadows in between trees growing blacker and the foliage taking on a gray tint . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nervously scans , trying to find the source of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) unease . 
A wave of something hits him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , grim and heavy . Gravity seems to grow exponentially stronger but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fights it , struggling to stay upright and standing . Then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sees it . 
Maybe it 's his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) imagination -- there 's shifting on a tree 15 feet to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) left , almost a crawling motion , digits spidering their way across the trunk . Pale fingers ... 
A hand , but not attached to a body . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chokes back a muffled cry of horror , stumbling a step before turning and sprinting in the opposite direction . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) runs from that evil aura , the emotions of hatred and vengeance and never-ending loneliness that threaten to swallow him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) whole . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is no expert on the_Spirit_World ($_to_the_Spirit_World) , but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows that that is not supposed to be there . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wheezes and weaves between trees , attempting to get away as fast as possible . 
The invading emotions slowly fade as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) puts distance between him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and the thing , to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) relief . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) slows down and leans against the thick trunk of a towering tree , trying to catch his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) breath . 
But a new sensation appears , less of a feeling and more of a magnetic pull . It 's the polar opposite of what he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) felt merely a few minutes ago : it 's hope , it 's reassurance and guidance . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) straightens up , tiredly shuffling in what he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thinks is the right direction . 
It is n't a far walk -- only about five minutes -- until he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) reaches the edge of the forest , the overhead canopy making way to purple blue sky and sloping green hills . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) merely blinks slowly , until a voice calls his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) name somewhere to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) left . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) turns to see the former avatar , picking his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) way over tree roots towards him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
Thank god . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) walks over to meet him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , the man 's presence putting him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) at ease . 
`` You ($_Midoriya_Izuku) have n't been here in a while , my boy , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says , clapping Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) on the back like an old friend rather than some kid he 's only met once . `` Troubles getting back to the Spirit World ? '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shrinks . `` Yes ... It took me a bit to figure out how to get here , but I think I 've got it now . '' 
`` I 'm glad -- I 've got a feeling that there would have been trouble , had you learned any later . '' 
The man gives him a small smile and a final back pat , then turning to sit on a raised tree root . He seems relaxed , nonchalant . 
But something in his words bother Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . He hesitates , then asks . 
`` What do you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mean by ` trouble ? ''' 
All_Might ($_All_Might) freezes , like he 's been caught in some secret act . It ($_All_Might) feels ... weird , pressing his childhood hero to share information with him , but Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stays firm , fixing his mentor with a questioning stare . 
He has to familiarize himself with his past life . They have to be open with each other , and that connection starts with no secrets . 
Something in Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's look must tell All_Might ($_All_Might) this ; he sighs . 
`` Well , I suppose you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) would 've learned sooner or later , anyhow , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says , scooching to the left and patting the root next to him . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pauses , then walks over to sit . 
There 's a moment of silence as All_Might ($_All_Might) formulates what to say ; he fiddles those long fingers of his and stares straight ahead . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) just watches his hands , letting the avatar think . 
The fingers stop promptly and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) locks eyes with his mentor , now donning a grim expression . 
`` I 'll cut to the chase : something dark is on the horizon , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says , black eyes boring into Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's . `` For both your world and mine . '' 
`` What ... What is it ? '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) asks hesitantly . 
All_Might ($_All_Might) sighs . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wish that I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knew , my ($_Midoriya_Izuku) boy . '' 
`` Well , what makes you think that , then ? Have you been seeing something , had to fight someone ? '' 
All_Might ($_All_Might) rises and stands in front of Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , almost as if the very thought of evil on the horizon makes him restless . 
`` There 's a group -- a league , I should say -- that has been dabbling with affairs in both the human world and the_Spirit_World ($_to_the_Spirit_World) . I 've spotted them a few times here , and some of my human correspondents in your realm have gotten glances , too . '' All Might scratches at the top of his head , staring off into the woods . `` They 're not sending people here so much as they are sending entities ... Always a cloud of dark mist or a hand ... '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shudders and All_Might ($_All_Might) stops . 
`` Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ? Did you see one of them ? '' 
The boy fidgets . “Um, yes.” He fiddles with his fingers , looking down at the ground . `` I thought I spotted a hand ... It felt like it was watching me . . And it was radiating these awful emotions ... '' 
All Might mutters curses under his breath , stepping forward to place a hand on Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's shoulders . 
`` I 'm sorry you had to witness that , my boy . I would be lying if I told you I knew what that thing is up to -- but I can say this , '' he says , locking eyes with his successor . `` Do n't try to find out what it is . Not yet.” 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) breathes sharply . `` But , All Might -- '' 
`` You ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 're not ready to face off with whatever this is , '' he cuts Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) off . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) understand you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) want to help , but for now the best thing you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can do is lay low and train . You ($_Midoriya_Izuku) have a lot of missed time to make up for . '' 
He has a point -- what could Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) even do right now ? The boy slumps a little , the argument lost . 
`` Do n't worry , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says . `` It has n't done anything too villainous , as of yet . Plus , I have contacts in the real world that are trying to find its source . We 'll know what it is , soon enough . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tenses at `` contacts , '' recalling what he came here to ask about . `` Uh , All_Might ($_All_Might) , about the real world ... '' 
`` You 're not sure what you 're supposed to be doing , right ? '' All_Might ($_All_Might) responds . `` We 're connected -- I ($_All_Might) can feel your confusion and apprehension towards the task at hand . '' 
The words stolen from his mouth , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) freezes for a second , then nods weakly . He shrugs away from the avatar 's grasp , rising from his seat and starting a nervous pace . 
`` I do n't even know where to start , '' he mutters , hand on his chin as he walks back and forth . `` Do I just come out and announce it ... '' 
`` Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . '' 
`` Or keep it quiet -- '' 
`` Breathe . '' 
`` Or just train in one element , or -- '' 
`` You 're overthinking this , my boy . '' 
`` But am I ? '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) frantically shoots back , stopping in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tracks . 
All_Might ($_All_Might) pauses , then belts out a laugh . 
It 's contagious -- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't help but crack into a smile , then a chuckle , and then a full laugh . 
They both laugh longer than the situation warrants , but when they finally stop , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels more relaxed . Something about the avatar just calls for calm -- in the face of the daunting , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) still manages to put on a smile . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) was n't the `` most charismatic avatar '' for nothing , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) guesses . 
`` I ($_All_Might) 'm sorry to laugh , kid -- I ($_All_Might) 'm just very happy to see you so serious about this , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says , seating himself again . `` Okay , back to business . You know the traditional path an avatar takes . '' 
`` Yes : you 're told of their role when you turn sixteen and then you embark on your journey to master the elements . You go in the order of the Avatar Cycle -- for me , that would be earth , fire , air , water , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) says . `` But I 've already diverged from all of that . '' 
`` True , '' the former avatar agrees . `` You 're making yourself out to be quite the nontraditional case . But that 's okay . Some of the best avatars of the past have strayed from the tradition and turned out perfectly fine . '' 
`` Yeah , but I bet all of them were able to bend before they turned fourteen , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) murmurs , earning a sad look from All_Might ($_All_Might) . 
`` You ca n't dwell on that , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , '' the man says softly . `` You 're a unique case . '' 
`` What did you say it was -- that my energy was blocked ? '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) questions . `` How did it suddenly get unblocked ? Why was it blocked in the first place ? '' 
`` Like I said earlier -- it was a combination of different factors : emotional stunting , insecurity , et cetera , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) replies , shifting on his perch . He scratches the top of his head , looking somewhere off into the landscape behind Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's shoulder . `` And -- er , this is n't for certain , but ... it may have also been my fault . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tenses . “What?” 
The avatar sighs . `` My fight with All For One did n't just leave my body scarred . They tried to keep it from the public -- it would have sent everything into even more chaos , if they had -- but : there was a spiritual aspect to what the Rebellion was trying to accomplish , as well . 
`` All For One had two main goals : firstly , to gain control of Harmony ($_Harmony) and , by extent , all four nations . But their second , more ominous goal , was ... crazy . Theoretically impossible. Unless , that is , you had a stable bridge to take you back and forth from the Spirit World . '' 
`` He was interested in looking for bending energy sources in the Spirit World -- that is , places that could ` grant ' bending . I guess you could say he wanted to become a pseudo-avatar . '' 
It 's faint -- a slight hesitancy to All_Might ($_All_Might) 's words , a tiny pause that drops like lead into Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's stomach . 
Is he afraid ? 
In an instant , All_Might ($_All_Might) suddenly seems so much smaller , so much more scared and lost and dead . 
Is this what 's in store for me , too ? Or will it be worse ? 
He shudders as All_Might ($_All_Might) begins to speak again . 
`` Now , whether places like that actually exist is entirely beyond my knowledge -- or if I could even take people with me when crossing worlds , but ... All For One wanted me to bring him to the Spirit World , regardless . And he was going to do it by force . '' 
`` So ... you were n't just fighting to stop them from taking Harmony ($_Harmony) , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) says . `` You were fighting to avoid being captured , too . '' 
All_Might ($_All_Might) nods . `` And what a fight it ($_All_Might) was . It ($_All_Might) took everything I had to hold him at bay . I 'm guessing you already know this , but I had to go into the_Avatar_State ($_the_Avatar_State) . No small feat , but it ($_the_Avatar_State) worked and I almost had him finished . But then I got hit . '' He grimaces at the memory , placing a hand over his concealed wound . `` I think that this was the first factor in blocking your energy . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) furrows his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) brow . `` But ... sustaining injuries in the_Avatar_State ($_the_Avatar_State) is n't enough to end the_Cycle ($_the_Cycle) . Or block energy . '' 
`` You 're right , the injury itself was n't what did it , '' the man replies , with a hint of ... embarrassment ? Shame ? `` But after taking that hit , I was ... I did n't know if I would win , and I did n't want to be the one to end the_Cycle ($_the_Cycle) . So I went out of the_State ($_the_Avatar_State) for the rest of the fight . '' 
A lightbulb goes off in Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's head . 
`` You were ashamed that you got scared for yourself , '' he states . `` And ashamed that you left the_State ($_the_Avatar_State) , even though staying in it ($_the_Avatar_State) could have ended the fight a lot sooner and saved more of the city . So you blocked a chakra point . '' 
All_Might ($_All_Might) blinks . `` Er . Yes. It seems like you know something about chakras . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) flushes , waving his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands in apology . `` Oh , I 'm so sorry -- that was insensitive of me -- '' 
`` No , my boy , it 's fine . '' All_Might ($_All_Might) gives him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) a small smile . `` Butting your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head into other people 's business is the mark of a good avatar . And it 's good to see you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) already know about your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chakras -- those are important . '' 
The blood does n't leave Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's face , and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) squeaks out a thank you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
`` So yes , like you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) said , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) starts again slowly . `` I did n't resolve my own emotional issues in my lifetime , and ended up clogging my fire chakra -- willpower , blocked by shame . '' 
`` But why would that block all of my bending ? '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) questions . 
`` Well -- my theory is that I did n't just have one chakra clogged . '' The man raises his right hand and points an index finger at his forehead . `` Thought chakra . Pure cosmic energy , blocked by worldly attachments . And I passed on with a lot of people that I wanted to save and a lot of people I wanted to bring to justice . '' 
`` And you think that carried over into my chakras , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) concludes . 
`` I 'll say that I was never quite as good at the whole ` spiritual aspect ' as some of the former avatars . So I do n't know if my running theory actually works , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says . `` And while I 've come to terms with my fate and emotions , I had to fix the Thought Chakra in person -- but some sort of disconnect between us kept you from coming here for fourteen years . '' 
So that 's what the whole forehead thing was last time , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thinks . But what kind of disconnect ... 
`` But what 's important is that you 're here now and you 've already bended two elements , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says , interrupting Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's thoughts . `` You 've also attempted water and fire , correct ? '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nods . `` But I was n't able to do either . I ca n't really figure out what I should be feeling when I bend those . '' 
`` Do n't rush it , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) advises . `` You 've only just entered the bending world , so start with earth , move to air , and then attempt the other two . Every avatar has an element they struggle with -- mine was fire . '' He looks Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) up and down . `` And I feel like yours will be , as well . '' 
`` How can you tell ? '' 
All Might tents his hands , fingertips on his lips . `` You 'll find that most firebenders have found sources for their bending that are ... Self-destructive . Angry . Not the true essence of what firebending is intended to be . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's brain spits out a mental picture of a snarling Kacchan , which he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoves down immediately . 
`` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feel as though you 've only ever witnessed that kind of firebending in your life . You might attempt to start off on the wrong foot , without the right master , '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) continues . `` And even then , it may take some time . The meanings of each element must be learned -- and as someone who 's always been on the receiving end of an angry firebender , its meaning might not come easy . '' 
The knowing look All_Might ($_All_Might) gives Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tells him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows all about Bakugou . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) returns a nervous smile . 
`` It will take time of course . I know you want to have a step-by-step plan , something to follow to the letter . But you must remember : a large aspect of being the avatar is following the flow of energy . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) must look confused , because the former avatar sighs . 
`` The flow -- whether it be in your bending , in conflicts , in your own life . You must learn to adapt accordingly and make split second decisions for the good of mankind , '' All_Might ($_All_Might) says . `` While I ($_All_Might) am here to give you advice , I ($_All_Might) am not always going to be there when you need to make tough choices in the spur of the moment . '' 
The boy already knew all that , but something about All Might saying it aloud makes it more real . 
`` Your hardships and battles will be different than mine ($_All_Might) . You can not copy me ($_All_Might) -- that 'll only end in tragedy . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gazes up at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) predecessor , the weight of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) words settling on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoulders . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can ask for guidance , but the final decisions will be up to him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can save the world , but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) might not be able to save himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
The nod of understanding he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gives feels like the click of a lock on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) heart . There 's no backing out ; his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fate is intertwined with that of the world . 
All_Might ($_All_Might) responds with a grim smile . 
`` So tell me ($_All_Might) , '' the man says , rising and turning to thread his way into the shadows of the trees . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begins to follow , only to have the scenery around him flicker out like a lightbulb . He 's once again in that black void , nothing but him , darkness , and the boom of his mentor 's voice . 
`` What are you going to do ? '' 
He trains like hell . 
If he 's going to train under anyone , he needs to make sure that his bones do n't shatter first . 
His immediate goal : fortify his plans for the future , fortify his body , and fortify his mind . 
Step number one : build muscle , work on power output , and prep himself for the Yuuei ($_Yuuei) entrance exam . 
He 's been doing this for years -- fragmenting his long term goals into smaller ones , staving off the pressure of his future by compartmentalizing it . He 'll still have to save the world someday , but for now he just has to focus on getting into Yuuei ($_Yuuei) . 
As to why he 's so dead set on Yuuei ($_Yuuei) ... it 's less of a specific reason and more of a feeling . 
Simply put , it feels like fate . 
-LRB- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't deny that All Might attending the school in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) youth plays a big factor in the magnetism of the school . -RRB- 
But the abundance of masters teaching there , the interdisciplinary focus in the bending , the probable contacts All_Might ($_All_Might) has there -- it seems like a place specifically founded to groom avatars . 
So Yuuei it is . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) life becomes a collage of bending matches , gyms , and the quiet lot behind his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) house . Anywhere where no one will stop him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) from practicing . When he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's not in school , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's sweating -- pulling up rocks , seeing which moves work for him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and which ones do n't . 
The internet helps him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) more than he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) would like to admit . Step-by-step power position tutorials , workout regiments , bending match videos -- they 're abundant and easily accessible , and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) compiling all of their combined knowledge together until he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has a semblance of an actual workout schedule . 
x
There are two aspects to the Yuuei practical exam : power and combat . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can learn combat moves by himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) by watching pro matches -- but the power portion might prove to be a challenge , without direction . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't figure out how to increase his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) power . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has a set limit , but honestly , it 's not enough . 
But when your mentor was notoriously good at interdisciplinary bending and using all of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) might in the fighting ring , it seems wasteful to just let that expertise slide . 
So Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) back in the Spirit World two weeks after their last encounter , luckily encountering no shadowy hands . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pitches his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) idea to All Might : teach Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) the motions and logistics of a power-maximizing earthbending move to help him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pass the exam . 
The proposition brings a smile to All_Might ($_All_Might) 's face . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) beams , then places a large hand on Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's head . 
`` Do n't worry , '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) assures . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) have just the move in mind . '' 
x
It 's backbreaking work . Even sleep no longer offers a refuge , due to power sessions with All_Might ($_All_Might) . 
School , combat training , power practice , repeat . The months fly by and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hardly notices . 
Of course there are moments when he doubts what he 's doing -- is Yuuei ($_Yuuei) actually worth this ? He 's the avatar -- ca n't he put off the hellish training until later ? He 's going to get a master no matter what , so why panic ? 
But as buzzes of the entrance exam begin to dance around the classroom , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is painfully reminded that this is him catching up . That what he 's doing right now is making up for fourteen years of inactivity , fourteen years of missed bending experience . 
If he wants to train with the best , he has to put himself on equal footing first -- his spiritual title does not give him to a free ride to Yuuei . 
So despite his doubts , despite his fatigue , he pushes forward . He sees results . 
He 's sturdier , in mind and in body . He has an artillery of combat actions at his disposal . He has an All Might specialty move , guaranteed to max his power output . 
When ten months are up and the exam looms over the horizon , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) actually feels like he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's standing at the starting line . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shuffles past the Yuuei ($_Yuuei) gates , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) throat in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stomach and his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) legs trembling . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) did okay on the written portion -- a lot of it was interdisciplinary bending logistics , the history of bending , and what-would-you-do scenarios . There were only one or two he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) did n't know at all , and a couple more he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) was hesitant about , but it seems likely he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) scored well . 
Now comes the tough part . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's forcing himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) to be calm , clasping his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands together to stop their shaking and taking deep , controlled breaths . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) closes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes . 
The worst that can happen is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to go to another bending school . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's prepared for this . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's done as much as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can . It 's all a matter of showing that work now . 
Slightly calmer , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's eyes flick back open . A small smile creeps onto his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) takes a big step forward -- 
Directly into a rock jutting out of the pavement . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) topples but his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mind stays strangely clear . 
Of course , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) brain sighs , resigned to its fate . Of COURSE you have to fall and break your arm right before the biggest exam of your life . You would n't be Midoriya Izuku if you did n't pull some clutzy move like this . So stupid. 
Right before he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gets a faceful of asphalt , however , there 's a whoosh and suddenly he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is n't falling . 
In fact , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's floating . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's eyes go wide and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) yelps , scrambling to get upright . The air begins to assist him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) upwards , bringing him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) from 20ş to 90ş . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feet firmly planted on the ground again , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) turns to find his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) savior . 
`` Are you okay ? '' A short girl with a gravity-defying bob smiles worriedly at him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , arms still raised from bending . Her big brown eyes look him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) up and down , questioning and caring . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) merely stares . 
`` Sorry for not asking before using my ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bending on you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , '' she continues , shifting her hands to grasp the strap of the satchel at her hip . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) figured it would be bad luck to trip before the exam ! '' 
She tilts her head and beams . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nearly go into cardiac arrest . 
`` Uh , '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eloquently responds . 
`` Well , we better get inside -- they 're starting soon . I 'm so nervous ! But let 's both do our best , okay ? '' 
`` Um , '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries again . 
`` Good luck ! '' she says , turning to continue her way across the courtyard . Only his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes follow , watching the swish of her yellow skirt as she climbs the stairs and vanishes inside the building . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't think of how mortifying that was . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't think of how experienced the benders he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's up against must be , for that girl to pull such a controlled stunt with no prep . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't even think about the dreaded exam . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) brain simply spits out : 
I talked to a girl ! 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stands there , beaming like an idiot , until someone bumps into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoulder . 
`` Get moving , shitty Deku , '' they growl . 
It pulls him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) out of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) reverie ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) jumps at the sight of Kacchan 's red glare boring into him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) -- but is then subsequently confused when the other boy just keeps walking forward to the doors . 
No taunting . No teasing . Nothing . 
It 's true that Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) had been a lot more reserved following the ... incident . Whereas previous help from Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) spurred on relentless insults , this_time_Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) seemed recoil from any contact at all . Is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ashamed ? Angry ? 
Either way , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds that the lack of attention -- positive or negative -- is off-putting . It feels like Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) is plotting something . 
-LRB- Or that Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) thinks he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's plotting something . -RRB- 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries to wipe that unease from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mind , changing his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts to the task ahead . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sighs , then follows his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) neighbor through those daunting doors . 
They 're greeted by a towering stage , the seats layered around it packed and chatter bouncing off the walls . A quick pitstop at the check-in table and the bestowing of the testing pack and seating assignments for the info session , then the two deposit themselves in chairs further back than Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) would like . 
The silence from Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) is deafening ; they both quietly pin on their numbers and pull on their armbands , neither acknowledging the other 's presence . 
The air is thick with tension , awkward shifting in seats and nervous gazes drifting over the throng of other students as they all await the test instructions . Some stretch in place , some control their breathing , and some just sit and stare . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) in the last category , trying to push down the trembling in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stomach as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) watches the experienced motions and sculpted muscles of the others around him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
What was he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thinking ? He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) literally only learned how to earthbend -- what , ten months ago ? These kids have been bending their whole lives . Who was he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) to think that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) could waltz in as some amateur and actually procure himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) a spot in the top bending school in the city ? 
Stupid, stupid, stupid. 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nervously adjusts the green armband on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) forearm -- an earthbender . Just an earthbender . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to keep it that way . 
If people find out that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's the avatar , they also find out that All_Might ($_All_Might) is dead . The fragile peace that All_Might ($_All_Might) 's image has upheld since the rebellion collapses , and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's forced to deal with the aftermath -- untrained . Imagine the sheer panic that would arise when people found out their current avatar was n't even able to bend up until 10 months ago . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) might consider telling some of the Yuuei ($_Yuuei) staff if he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) actually gets in -- some of them might already know , even -- , but it 's essential that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) keep this secret until he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's mastered Earth at least . 
Of course , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to get into Yuuei ($_Yuuei) first . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts are interrupted when he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) notices what appears to be their instructor . 
A man in airbending reds and yellows takes to the stage , swaggering over to the podium and tapping at the mic a few times . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) glances at some papers laid out in front of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , then looks up at the crowd of students ahead . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) uses one hand to slick his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pointy yellow hair back , and the other to read whatever is written on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) notes . 
When he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's done , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks up , smiles , and then shouts . 
`` HOW 'S IT GOIN ' , PROSPECTIVE YUUEI STUDENTS ? '' 
The students all slam their hands over their ears , the mic turned up way too high for someone who is obviously naturally pretty loud . 
The_man ($_Midoriya_Izuku) glances at someone at the back of the stage , pulling his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mouth away from the mic . 
`` What -- you want me to ? '' He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gestures at the mic , then at himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . More gesticulating , then a look of understanding . `` Oh , you want me to not use the mic ? Okay , that 's cool . That 's fair . '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) steps away from the podium , then starts again . 
`` Sorry for that . Good morning , examinees ! I hope you 're ready to TEST ! '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya) gasps with recognition , clapping a hand over his ($_Midoriya) mouth . 
`` That 's -- that 's Yamada Hizashi ! Present Mic ! '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) whispers excitedly . `` Bending match announcer and pro airbender for the -- '' 
`` Stop fangirling and fucking pay attention , dipshit , '' Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) growls . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shuts up instantly , but a smile still tugs at the corners of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mouth . 
`` Let 's get right to it ! As you all know , Yuuei ($_Yuuei) is a multi-disciplinary combat school with a focus on bending and fighting 's active use in careers , '' Yamada ($_Yamada) says , gesturing at the Jumbotron behind him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) as it blinks from the school logo to the number 2 . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , in turn , raises two fingers . `` That 's why we 'll be testing you on two different aspects : power and combat . '' 
# 1 , the jumbotron reads . Power . 
`` First , we have to gage how much power you can put into your bending , '' Yamada ($_Yamada) explains . `` We need to have you at a certain caliber of bending before we can do any work with you . Airbenders will go for speed , firebenders for distance and heat , waterbenders for distance , and earthbenders for height . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks down at the table in front of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . Yeah , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's been working on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) power output through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sessions with All_Might ($_All_Might) , but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is n't sure how that will stack up against the other benders here . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'll just have to do his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) best . 
`` Remember : power comes from many different sources in bending , '' Yamada ($_Yamada) says , almost as a side-note . `` There 's sheer power , there 's technical power -- we do n't care whichever one you use , as long as your output is good . '' 
# 2 : Combat . 
`` And here 's the fun part -- the combat , '' the_man ($_Midoriya_Izuku) says with a devious grin . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gulps . 
`` We have multiple bending rings set up , each with their own stationed team , '' Yamada ($_Yamada) says , waving a hand at an animated fighting ring behind him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . `` We 've assigned you into teams of four . Your task is simple : beat the other team . '' 
A murmur goes across the room , students glancing at one another . 
`` Now , just beating the other team is n't gon na be enough to pass , of course . We 're grading you on a multitude of other things . But I 'll tell you this : the more hits you get on the other team , the better . You do n't want to be a bystander for this test . '' 
`` You 'll get more info on the combat portion right before you fight , '' Yamada ($_Yamada) says . `` But for now : go show us some power ! '' 
His following wink rallies the students ; there 's a burst in noise from the crowd , with students vying to escape their seats and get to the testing sites first . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) follows hesitantly behind them , the reality of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) competition now dawning on him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
x
They 're broken into groups and taken down to different testing sites . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and Bakugou ($_this_time_Bakugou) are separated -LRB- thank god -RRB- , and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't bother mingling with the other examinees as they walk out onto the field -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't think his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stomach could take it . 
It 's a typical green field , but with a painted white line differentiating the testing zone from the observation zone . The students amass right on the line . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) edges his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) way to the front of the crowd , opting to fight his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nervousness by observing other students ' tests . As he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) waits for the test to begin , someone chimes right next to him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
`` You ($_Midoriya_Izuku) made it ! '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) left to see his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) savior from earlier : the airbending girl . Somehow , they ended up in the same testing group -- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is n't sure whether he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's happy or sad about that . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fidgets . 
`` U-uh . Yep ... '' 
She looks a little more serious from earlier , the smile she returns not making it all the way to her eyes . She must be nervous , too . 
`` Well , good luck ! '' Without another word , she goes back to watching the field . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is grateful for her not wanting to small-talk -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) would puke . 
The_proctor ($_the_proctor) makes his ($_the_proctor) way into the testing zone , scanning a clipboard . `` All right , '' he ($_the_proctor) begins . `` First , students here based on recommendation . Line up . '' 
A group of six students step forward , their only notable difference from the other examinees being a secondary golden arm band . 
They represent all four elements , but they all have an air of confidence around themselves -- majority of them are guaranteed a spot at the school , whether it be due to money , ability , or both . 
Whereas Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) had to fight just to stand at the starting line with everyone else , these people are already leagues ahead of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
Their following displays are appropriately fantastic : a girl launches a water whip at break-neck speeds , some boy forces a column of rock at least three stories high . 
But the test that catches everyone 's attention is a boy with strange white and red hair . 
As he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) takes to the field , something about him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) seems familiar -- his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hair ? The dignity he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) carries himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) with ? Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't see his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face , but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's seen this kid before . 
The_examinee ($_Midoriya_Izuku) seems to have tuned the rest of the world out . As soon as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's given the go ahead , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) swirls his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms in a loose circle , wrists twisting and elegantly pulling and pushing . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't help but be entranced by the display ; they 're the moves of an experienced waterbender , but something looks off -- instead of the calmness and patience of typical waterbending , the motions look borderline angry , fast and sometimes even jagged . 
The boy 's palms spark . 
With a sharp jump and thrust , a jet of flames erupts from his hands , leaving a charred line of grass half a football field long . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) flinches . 
His eyes finally drift down to the boy 's armband : red . Fire Nation . But what kind of bending was that ? It was more waterbending than firebending -- and in a test where you 're try to maximize power output , you definitely want to draw more on firebending technique . 
The boy looks unfazed , merely straightening up and relaxing with an indifferent expression . It 's not until he turns to face the rest of the group that Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) spots the mass of red puckered flesh on his left eye and things click together . 
A scar . Strangely colored hair . Calm , removed . Firebending that looks like waterbending . 
That 's ... . 
That 's ... . 
`` Hey , um , '' the airbender girl says from beside him . `` You 're kind of staring . At Todoroki Shouto . Y’ know . The Firelord 's son . The one that hates staring . '' 
At the sound of his name , the prince turns and locks eyes with him . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) snaps out of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) trance , jerking to attention and whipping his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head to the side in a TOTALLY subtle attempt to play it off . 
`` W-was I ? '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nervously asks , eyes jumping across the backs of other testers , at the buildings -- anywhere but Todoroki ($_Todoroki) . `` Haha , oops ... '' 
The girl starts laughing , to which a nearby boy almost immediately chimes in to tell her that laughing during an exam is disrespectful , and she ought to be ashamed , and if she aims to be a top bender , she should be paying extremely close attention , and a million other things that Midoriya tunes out . When he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gages it 's been long enough , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shyly peeks at the prince again . 
Todoroki ($_Todoroki) 's mismatched eyes are still trained on him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , the quiet intensity of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gaze making Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fidget . It feels like he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's being analyzed -- like this boy is sinking under his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) skin and paging through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) weaknesses and secrets . 
It 's scary . 
The prince finally looks away and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) releases a breath he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) did n't know he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) was holding . 
`` Can I go ? '' Todoroki ($_Todoroki) asks , turning to the test proctor . `` I ($_Todoroki) 've done my ($_Todoroki) required testing . '' 
`` I ($_Todoroki) 'm afraid not , Your Highness , '' the_proctor ($_the_proctor) says . `` You have to stay here until all examinees have finished the power gaging portion of the exam . I ($_the_proctor) 'm sorry for all the formalities , but -- well , rules are rules . '' 
Todoroki ($_Todoroki) sighs , then calmly moves his way off the testing lawn and into the crowd . He accidentally bumps into the next recommendee in line , a buzzcut-headed airbender , but does n't apologize and keeps moving . The airbender side-eyes him before stepping up to test . 
The prince looks robotic . Icy . Not anything like what would be expected of the Firelord 's son . 
What happened to him ? What must his home life be like , to make him that cold ? 
But Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is brought back to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) current predicament when the airbender spontaneously unleashes a tornado on the testing field , ripping up the grass and unrooting nearby bushes . Oh, right. He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to go up against that . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) twitches in place as the_proctor ($_the_proctor) tells the boy to contain the storm and go back into the crowd . 
`` That concludes the recommendee testing , '' the_proctor ($_the_proctor) says . `` Now we 'll move on to standard testing -- and I ($_the_proctor) must remind recommendees that they 're to stay put for this portion , as well . '' He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) glances at Todoroki , who has melted somewhere into the back of the crowd . 
`` Everyone , please section off into your respective elements . '' 
With a shy smile , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and the airbending girls part ways . The_proctor ($_the_proctor) announces the order of elements : water , earth , fire , air . 
The following displays are n't as intimidating as the recommendees ' , but they still put Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) on edge . The waterbenders move the water like extensions of their own bodies , nonchalantly blasting streams across the field . 
When they move onto earthbending , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) starts feeling intimidated . 
Yes , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has put on weight and packed on muscle . But he 's still a shrimp compared to some of the muscles he sees on his fellow earthbenders . Sculpted calves , broad backs , and flat pecs -- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels like he accidentally signed up for a bodybuilding show that he was horribly unprepared for . 
But All_Might ($_All_Might) 's advice comes to mind . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , there 's a misconception about earthbending that you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 're fixated on , he remembers All Might telling him one session when he was getting particularly frustrated with the move . 
Know this : muscle mass does not equate to power . 
No , power in bending comes from the strength of your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) own internal energy -- your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) body must be able to hold that power , of course , but your ($_Midoriya_Izuku) main focus should be keeping that energy strong and pure when you ($_Midoriya_Izuku) push it into the elements . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) breathes deeply . Focus on himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . Focus on doing the move right . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) almost does n't notice the test in front of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has finished . 
The_proctor ($_the_proctor) pauses for a moment before reading the next name . 
`` Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) Izuku . '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) jumps at the sound of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) name , then begins to edge his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) way through the crowd with slumped shoulders . 
The prolonged look the_proctor ($_the_proctor) gives him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels too significant to ignore -- does he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) knows ? Does everyone in Yuuei know ? He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) swallows hard , then assumes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) power stance . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gazes down at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands , trying to calm his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) heartbeat and praying he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's not about to do something that is n't earthbending . 
`` Whenever you 're ready , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , '' the_proctor ($_the_proctor) says , making the boy flinch . 
Okay , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) : remember your training . You worked with All_Might ($_All_Might) on this -- you should have this in the bag . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shifts , steadying his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feet and shifting his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) weight into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) heels . This is the easy part . 
A deep breath . 
Then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begins . 
The move is awkward and more handsy than normal earthbending -- in a slow and deliberate movement , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) moves his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms upwards from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) core and out in a circle . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands meet at the top ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) calmly lowers them , clasped over his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) heart . 
Draw power from your core , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hears All Might say . Bring your heart 's energy into your hands , then out through your feet and into the ground . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) imagines that energy transfer , sees his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) power bleed out of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chest and into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands . 
Down and steady , my boy . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands move lower towards the ground , dragging the energy into the earth below . 
And… Now! 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thrusts his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands skyward in a singular decisive movement , the ground following the motion . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) holds it , waits for the rumbling above to halt . And then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) breaks stance , oddly drained after the display . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) cranes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head upwards , panting . It rivals the earthbending he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's seen thus far -- it might even be higher . 
But the important thing is that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) actually did it . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) actually correctly did the move All_Might ($_All_Might) taught him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) exits the bending zone with a small smile on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face , bubbling with internal pride . It makes him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feel slightly better about the next portion of the exam -- at least he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) performed well on one half of the practical . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) settles into the crowd , content to silently watch the next bending feats . 
“Hey.” 
It 's a hollow voice , cool and controlled . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) turns to look at the speaker , ready to greet them in turn . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) flinches when he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sees it 's none other than the Fire Nation Prince , Todoroki_Shouto ($_Todoroki_Shouto) . 
-LRB- Is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) supposed to bow ? Prostrate on the floor and kiss his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoes ? Oh god what is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) supposed to do . -RRB- 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) instead opts to blink at the other boy , lost for words . Todoroki ($_Todoroki) must be used to awed silence -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) speaks in Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's stead . 
`` That was an All Might specialty move , '' the prince states , unwavering . 
“Um. Y-yes ? '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) says . 
Todoroki ($_Todoroki) does nothing but continue to stare and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mentally slaps himself for forgetting . 
`` Oh god , I mean -- yes , Your Highness , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) backtracks , face suddenly hot and palms uncomfortably sweaty . `` I admired -- '' 
`` Do n't call me that , '' Todoroki ($_Todoroki) objects . “Please. I ca n't stand it when people associate me with my jerk of a father . '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) reels at the nonchalant insult -- of course , there were rumors that the heir did n't get along with the_Firelord ($_the_Firelord) , but to be so open about it ($_the_Firelord) ... . 
Todoroki_Shouto ($_Todoroki_Shouto) must truly not care about family image . 
“Okay…. Todoroki ($_Todoroki) , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stammers . `` But , um , yes , I admired All_Might ($_All_Might) a lot as a kid , and I picked up a lot of his bending tricks from watching his matches . '' 
`` That one stunt combines aspects of firebending with a basic earthbending move in order to amplify power output , '' Todoroki ($_Todoroki) says without missing a beat . `` It 's supposed to take years to master -- they say you can only learn it at Yuuei or from All Might himself . '' 
Is it hot out here ? Or is it just Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ? God , it 's boiling . 
Haha , I 'm so dead . 
`` I. Well . Hm , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stammers , pulling at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) collar and cringing under Todoroki ($_Todoroki) 's steady gaze . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) guess ... I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'm just a quick learner ? '' 
Todoroki ($_Todoroki) does n't move and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's eyes flick around the surrounding crowd , desperately avoiding eye contact . The sensation of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) skin being peeled back by the prince 's gaze has now amplified into the feeling of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) skin being flayed . It takes all of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) willpower to avoid scampering off . 
`` ... Sure , '' Todoroki ($_Todoroki) says finally in the voice of someone utterly unconvinced . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) scans Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) one more time , then turns without comment and walks back into the crowd . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) resists the urge to start hyperventilating . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gets the sense that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) just had a very close call , even though there 's no way in hell that Todoroki ($_Todoroki) could have known anything about some common Earth Kingdom kid like him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . It was the sheer speculative power of the prince alone that nearly blew his cover -- that , and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's horrendous ability to keep secrets . 
If he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) actually gets into Yuuei ($_Yuuei) , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'll have to watch himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) around the heir . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) watches the rest of the examinees in a daze . It 's one amazing performance after the next -- they blend together in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mind and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) both intimidated and inspired . 
This is what he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) could be if he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gets into Yuuei ($_Yuuei) . 
This is the power he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) could practice beside , the people he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) could befriend . 
-LRB- He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries to ignore the sensation of mismatched , suspicious eyes attached to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) back . -RRB- 
When the final test is complete , the_proctor ($_the_proctor) calls for them to gather into their respective elemental groups and to head inside -- further instructions will be provided there . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) leaves the field , a sense of foreboding lodging itself in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stomach . 
x
When he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds out the second portion of the match involves them wearing pro-bending uniforms , it 's simultaneously a nightmare and a dream-come-true . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stands in front of the strewn out clothes , knowing he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to dress fast but taking his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) time regardless . How many times has he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wanted to do this ? To wear these uniforms , to fight in the pro-bending ring ? 
But he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't get any pleasure from it right now -- the stakes are too high . 
The rules of the match echo through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pulls off his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) own sweats and picks up the black shirt and pants . 
`` This wo n't be your normal pro-bending match , with rounds and territory gains , '' Yamada shares , seated backwards in a chair in the small classroom . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks far too casual for something that will make or break Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's future . 
`` Instead , it 's one 5-minute round , with your sole objective being to push the other team off the back . '' 
The padded underclothes are tight and restrictive ; Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) yanks them on and wishes he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) had asked for a size up . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's grown more than he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thought he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) had . 
`` The bare minimum to pass is KO'ing the other team . Individual scoring is based on how many hits on your opponents you each make . '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shrugs the thick padding on over his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoulders , yanks the green sash around his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) waist tighter , and deposits the helmet on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) exits the room , swerving a left and going to the entry hall . 
`` You 'll want to keep as many of your teammates in the ring as you can , while also getting in as many hits on the enemy as possible . '' 
The lights of the arena are blinding ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) squints as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stumbles his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) way into the ring . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pays no mind to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) teammates , solely focused on calming himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) down before the match . 
`` If you fall out of the ring , you fail . '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) closes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes and inhales deeply . This is it . 
Some voice in the back of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head prompts him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) to wonder how Bakugou ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) is faring in all of this -- but considering this is Bakugou_he_'s_thinking_about ($_Bakugou_he_thinking_about) he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's thinking about , there 's no reason to be worried . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) needs to focus on himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . 
“Hi again!” 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) jumps at the cheery voice interrupting his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts , then flushes when he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) spots the speaker : pixie bob girl . 
`` Looks like we 're on the same team , huh ? '' she notes , eyes skimming over Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , then the other two team members behind him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . `` The other two do n't seem to be terribly friendly . The waterbender glared at me when I tried to talk to him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and the firebender was a little zoned out . I do n't think they 're into the whole teamwork thing , y’ know ? '' 
`` Uh-huyeah , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) says , internally slapping himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) for the mix of gibberish he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't help but spew . 
Luckily , the girl does n't seem to mind . Maybe she 's used to it . `` Oh well , I guess we 'll just have to watch each others ' backs . I 'm Uraraka , by the way ! '' 
Uraraka ($_Uraraka) : bright , beautiful . How fitting. 
`` M-Midoriya , '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) replies . 
`` Nice to meet ya , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ! '' She drops her helmet on her head , gives him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) a final smile and thumbs up , then paces ahead of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) to the middle line . 
Well , at least that 's one advantage . Uraraka ($_Uraraka) seems to be a pretty experienced bender -- even if airbending is n't terribly offensive , she 'll still cover for him ($_Uraraka) . 
It 's a small comfort but a comfort nonetheless ; he ($_Uraraka) joins his ($_Uraraka) team at the start point . 
The following information the referee spits out sound like meaningless garble in his ears . Not that it matters -- he already knows the rules by heart . Instead , he takes the time to focus himself , to peek glances at his opponents and teammates . 
The other team is just as terrifying as he anticipated . He 's not sure if they 're Yuuei students or hired benders , but they 're older and hardened . They look sure of themselves and their bending , and face the prospective students with countenances of grim determination . 
His team is ... not quite so confident . Like Uraraka ($_Uraraka) said , the firebender looks dazed and confused . The waterbender looks near murderous . 
But the face that scares him the most is Uraraka ($_Uraraka) 's . Gone is her ($_Uraraka) cheery disposition and airy smile ; instead , all he sees is icy willpower . Her ($_Uraraka) eyes pick apart the other team as well , dancing over their arms and legs and gauging their faces . 
This girl means business . 
Rather than put him at ease , it disorients him further -- he 's not the only one desperate to get in here . Is sabotage an option in this match ? What if she ($_Uraraka) steals points from him ? 
Quit it , quit it , quit it ! He scolds himself internally , too lost in thought to notice the teams slowly edging towards their back boundaries and the ref raising a pointed hand . 
There 's literally no logic in Uraraka ($_Uraraka) trying to beat you ! You 're on the same team , you both have to survive ! Regardless , you 'll get enough points anyway , you 've done the work and -- 
`` -- riya ! '' 
He startles , whipping around to see Uraraka ($_Uraraka) shouting at him . 
`` They 're about to start ! '' 
He stumbles into Zone_1 ($_Zone_1) and tries to sink into fighting position when a sharp voice booms overhead . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks upwards , pupils shrinking in shock . 
`` ... 2 , 1 : GO . '' 
He does n't even have time to blink before something solid thumps into his stomach , sending him tumbling backwards and into Zone_2 ($_Zone_2) . He wheezes a curse under his breath and then hauls himself to his feet , scanning the scene ahead . 
The match can only have been going on for ten seconds , but it 's already sheer chaos . The arena is a multitude of one-on-one battles : his waterbender is trying to get a blow on the opposing airbender , their firebender is being relentlessly pelted with stone disks -- she 's already in Zone 3 , yikes -- , and Uraraka ($_Uraraka) is cartwheeling across Zone_1 ($_Zone_1) to avoid fire blasts . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) raises a disk and angles it to hit the enemy earthbender , but then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) realizes . 
Wait. 
... Where 's their waterbender ? 
The answer comes with a jet of water to the stomach . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lands on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) butt but then uses his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ground contact to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) advantage , shooting out energy through the floor and calling for a nearby stone disk . The disk soars to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands , which he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) then wields as a makeshift shield against the water strikes . The gaping hole in the middle means it does n't offer as much protection as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'd like , but it 's all that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's got . 
The blasts come in one-second intervals and with all the force of a train ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) peeks from around the side of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) blockade to see the waterbender , at the edge of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) Zone 1 and with firmly planted feet . 
Okay -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to somehow distract the waterbender to keep from getting blasted , then aim a disk at him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) to score a point . But how? 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes leap across the field , settling on the duel between his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) team 's waterbender and the enemy airbender . That fight is almost over -- one more hit on the airbender and she 'll be off the back . 
Time for a risk . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) waits for a water-free moment , then flings his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shield as hard as possible at the airbender . 
It does n't connect , but it disorients her ; taking advantage of the distraction , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) team 's waterbender propels a column of water towards the enemy that hits her dead-on . She soars to the back of the arena and over the edge . 
Nice. One enemy down and one teammate free to assist . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gets pelted with water again -- but with nothing free to block it , the force pushes him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) uncomfortably close to the Zone 3 line . Gritting his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) teeth , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) leans into the stream so he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands and knees . 
As soon as the water lets up , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) leaps upright , stomping the ground and summoning another disk from the ground . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'll have to make this fast . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) keeps up the disk 's momentum with his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms , flinging the rock and his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) energy directly at the waterbender , poised for a direct hit and his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) first point -- 
Water makes it to the enemy first , slamming into him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and pushing him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) into Zone_2 ($_Zone_2) . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's disk whizzes overhead and out of the ring . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) drops his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms and cranes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head to look at the water 's source . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) teammate , wheeling his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms and prepping another water blast , does n't even look at him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shoots the enemy waterbender off the back and out of the ring . So much for teamwork . 
-LRB- They only have two enemies left now , but Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't be happy about it . -RRB- 
A glance at the clock : 2 minutes left . 
Holy crap , only two minutes left already ? He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) still does n't have any points ! Who’s even left to hit? 
Their firebender must have been knocked out -- she 's nowhere to be seen . But the odds are still in their favor : three versus two . 
Uraraka ($_Uraraka) is now engaged with the earthbender -- she 's struggling , but she 's staying put in Zone_1 ($_Zone_1) . The firebender stands in the middle of Zone_2 ($_Zone_2) , looking to pick a fight . 
Okay , there 's Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's target . 
The firebender , however , notices him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) first : she volleys off a round of fireballs right at him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's forced to roll to the side . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) pushes onto his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feet and breaks into a run when the fire keeps coming . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's only done defense so far -- but what else can he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) do ? How can he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fight when the_enemy ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wo n't even let him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) plant himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and utilize his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bending ? 
Nearing the edge of the Zone 2 and Uraraka ($_Uraraka) 's fight , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has no choice but to turn around and backtrack -- he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's going to get hit . 
Unless he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gets a distraction ... . 
“Uraraka!” Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shouts , praying that she 'll be able to spare a moment . `` Some air , please ! '' 
She jerks at her name , looking towards Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and narrowly sidestepping an oncoming earth disk from her opponent . Her gaze jumps over his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fight , and then a spark of understanding leaps into her eyes . She nods . 
Whole arms twisting in a full-body circle , she inhales deeply and holds . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) shifts his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) core to head back in the direction he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) came from . 
Uraraka ($_Uraraka) exhales and hell breaks loose . 
Something resembling a tornado erupts from her , spiraling towards the enemy firebender and redirecting her fireballs into a now fiery vortex . Eyes wide under her helmet , the opponent runs into Zone_3 ($_Zone_3) to dodge it ($_Zone_3) . 
Now! Now Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can go for the hit . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) plants himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , raising a disk . 
But before he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can even aim it ($_Zone_3) , the wind catches up to the firebender . She soars upwards , then off the edge and into the watery pit below along with the tornado . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stares , desperation clawing at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) core . 
`` One hit ! '' he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) cries in frustration . `` I ($_Midoriya_Izuku) just need one hit ! '' 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) looks dully at the scene ahead -- there 's just one more person to score hits on , and Uraraka ($_Uraraka) seems to have that fight on lock . Or maybe the waterbender will try to snatch points from him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) again , if he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's still here . 
Turning around , however , the waterbender is nowhere to be found . It looks like it 's just him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and Uraraka ($_Uraraka) . But she 's more than capable -- if he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tried to interfere , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 'd probably just mess her up . 
There 's a dull thud and someone yelps . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) whips around to see Uraraka ($_Uraraka) pinned under an earth disk , the opposing team 's earthbender stalking over . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) gives a harsh stomp and a disk slides under his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) captive , the sharp motion making her wheeze . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's eyes flit over to the clock : 30 seconds . 30 seconds until they win . 
However , if Uraraka ($_Uraraka) gets knocked out of the ring and it 's just him ($_Uraraka) and this other guy left ... Then they have to face off in a tiebreaker . 
Which , yes , is an opportunity for actual points , if Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wins . 
But it also means that Uraraka ($_Uraraka) fails . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thrusts his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands upwards and raises a disk from the ground . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) repeats the motion again , and again , and again until he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has a 10-foot stack of disks hovering directly in front of him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) grunts under the strain , legs screaming in protest , but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) manages to stay upright . 
Meanwhile , the_enemy ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is in position , arms pushing out from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) body in a fluid gesture and sending Uraraka ($_Uraraka) 's rock coffin hurtling towards the edge -- 
With a guttural yell , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) slams both his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fists into the side of the stack and sends it flying at the opponent . The guy looks up in time for it to pummel into him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , rocketing him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) away from Uraraka ($_Uraraka) and towards the opposite edge . 
The impact from the blow sends a shudder up both of Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's arms and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) swears he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can feel them fracture in at least five different places . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms become pure , unadulterated pain . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) collapses . 
Everything seems hazy as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) watches his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) missile erupt into a billowing cloud of dust , watches the_enemy ($_Midoriya_Izuku) emerge dirty but unscathed . The_man ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lifts his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels a disk slide under him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) and two disks rise to box him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) in on both sides , sending a new wave of searing heat through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't move . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) surroundings are shifting ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's speeding towards the edge and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's accepted that there 's nothing he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can do , that his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) exam is over . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) clears the side and hangs in the great open space , right before that 20 foot plunge into icy water below -- 
But gravity never kicks in . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) simply floats there , 20 feet above failure . And then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) realizes . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lolls his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head to the side and spots Uraraka ($_Uraraka) , lower half still trapped in earth disks but right wrist frantically twisting to keep him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) up . The earthbender is nowhere to be seen . 
She adds her left arm to the movement , circling her hands over each other and towards herself , and Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begin to drift back . 
When the ground is finally below him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , Uraraka ($_Uraraka) stops bending . Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) drops the 3 feet to the floor and gives a weak croak of protest on impact . His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes drift to the clock in time to see big flashing zeroes -- 
`` Aaaaaand your exam is over ! '' Yamada yells over the intercom . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) blinks . 
All that training . All that work . And:
`` I got one hit . Just one hit , '' Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) moans , dropping his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) head to the ground . `` What kind of a bender am I ... '' 
There 's something wet on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) cheek and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) closes his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes , trying to tune out the irrepressible pain shooting up his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms . It seeps into his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) brain , clouding his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts , and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fights to stay awake . 
`` ... him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) to the healers , now ! '' 
One hit . 
`` ... what was that stunt ... '' 
One hit . 
`` ... sure she 's okay , get her a bag ... . '' 
One hit . 
The acrid smell of vomit reaches his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) nose and everything is overwhelming -- the noises are overwhelming and his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thoughts are overwhelming and the pain is overwhelming . 
`` ... he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's repeating one hit , why ... . '' 
I failed . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) brain flickers off . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't eat much those next few days . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) arms are healed , layers of bandages and worried looks from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mother the only evidence that anything happened . 
But the events of the exam plague his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mind , looping over and over as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries to settle back into normalcy , as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries to come to terms with what just happened and what to do next . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's not going to Yuuei . That much seems obvious . 
Sure , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) stayed in the ring -- but no way that was enough to get him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) into the school , not when others were scoring hits by the hundreds . 
Bakugou ($_Bakugou) got in -- Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't have to speculate on that . He ($_Bakugou) 's dreading seeing the smug look on his ($_Bakugou) face in class the day after they find out , feels nauseous thinking about facing the class when they knew what would happen the whole time . 
Maybe Uraraka ($_Uraraka) got in . Maybe she 'll remember that silly earthbending kid that could n't even score a hit , take pity and call to hang out sometime . Maybe some good will actually come out of the exam . 
He ($_Bakugou) sits on the couch , squeezing a weight in his ($_Bakugou) fist and evaluating other schools to look into , other masters he ($_Bakugou) can learn from . 
But it feels wrong -- it feels like he ($_Bakugou) should be following in All Might 's steps and learning at Yuuei ($_Yuuei) . 
How is he ($_Bakugou) supposed to be great if he ($_Bakugou) is n't learning from the greats ? What important friendships would he ($_Bakugou) have made with the four nation 's up and coming leaders -- like the Fire Nation heir ? How much easier would the path ahead have been , had he ($_Bakugou) made those connections early ? 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) thinks of Todoroki 's empty , calculating eyes and shudders . 
True , the_prince ($_Bakugou) did n't seem so easy to befriend . But being classmates at Yuuei ($_Yuuei) would have been a good start . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is trapped in a cycle of misery -- thinking of all that could have been and all that would never be . His ($_Bakugou) mother , the saint that she is , has allowed him ($_Bakugou) to mope for the week , only prompting him ($_Bakugou) to eat and go to school . But otherwise , she 's let him ($_Bakugou) be . She saw it coming and understands that he ($_Bakugou) needs time to come to terms . 
He ($_Bakugou) does n't respond when his ($_Bakugou) mom announces she 's going downstairs to grab the mail . But when he ($_Bakugou) hears the thud of feet running up the stairs , he ($_Bakugou) knows . 
`` I-Izuku ! '' His ($_Bakugou) mom cries , crashing into the living room and presenting him ($_Bakugou) a simple envelope . The Yuuei seal glistens on the front . `` It 's here ! '' 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) simply stares at the black lettering for a moment . 
Then he ($_Bakugou) silently rises from the couch , taking the letter from her hand and walking to his ($_Bakugou) room . The door closes behind him ($_Bakugou) with a resolute click and he ($_Bakugou) takes a deep breath . 
Welp , this is it . 
Here is the confirmation that he ($_Bakugou) needs a new plan . 
He ($_Bakugou) sits at his ($_Bakugou) desk , fingers hesitating at the seal . But impatience and curiosity soon overtake his ($_Bakugou) fears and he ($_Bakugou) rips it open , pulling the folded paper from inside and flattening it out . He ($_Bakugou) hungrily begins to read . 
`` Midoriya_Izuku ($_Midoriya_Izuku) , '' it ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begins , not sparing even a moment for pleasantries . `` The following letter encloses the results of your entrance exam to Yuuei Bending Academy . '' 
Below the sentence is a chart . Column one : Written Exam . Column two : Power output . Column three : Combat score . 
The written exam is what he ($_Bakugou) expected : he ($_Bakugou) passed . Not with flying colors , but with a sizeable margin . 
The power score is actually better than he ($_Bakugou) expected . 27 feet , a solid 10 feet above the average earthbending score . 
But the combat column is where he ($_Bakugou) trembles . The `` 1 '' draws his ($_Bakugou) eyes in like a magnet , confirming his ($_Bakugou) fears . 
He ($_Bakugou) did n't score nearly high enough to get in . 
He ($_Bakugou) 's toast . 
Resigned , he ($_Bakugou) lets his ($_Bakugou) eyes drift down to the sentence directly following the chart . 
`` Welcome to Yuuei . '' 
His ($_Bakugou) eyes skim over the words , then he ($_Bakugou) double-takes . He ($_Bakugou) backtracks and reads it again . 
It stays the same : `` Welcome to Yuuei . '' 
This has to be some sort of mistake . He ($_Bakugou) has to call them , to tell them they sent him ($_Bakugou) the wrong letter . 
He ($_Bakugou) skims the sentences below that , trying to gauge who the letter was actually meant for . The special observations section catches his ($_Bakugou) eye . 
`` Note that another examinee on your combat team expressed a wish to share hit points with you ; this tells us you are cooperative and show a good temperament for collaboration . '' 
Uraraka -- it has to be Uraraka . She wanted to share points with me ? 
`` While lacking in the hits category in combat , you made up for those lost points in the teamwork/rescue portion of the test . Your teachers will work with you on your offense , but you demonstrate promise in rescue fields or teamwork-oriented bending jobs . '' 
... Teamwork and cooperation ? 
His gaze leaps back up to the chart , honing in on a subsection he missed beforehand : rescue points . The whopping `` 59 '' under it sharply contrasts the `` 1 '' in the hits category . 
It 's not a mistake . 
He ... 
He actually got into Yuuei . 
A drop of water lands on the letter and blurs some of its ink , but Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) finds that he does n't care . It 's not until he starts crying in earnest that his mom worriedly raps on the door and asks to come in . 
Of course his first instinct is to tell All_Might ($_All_Might) . 
The former avatar probably already knows , what with their spiritual connection and his worldly contacts . But Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wants to tell him in person regardless , to thank him for the help and to maybe get some advice on how to proceed . 
He 'll admit -- All_Might ($_All_Might) does n't seem so godlike anymore . If anything , he 's a source of comfort , a pillar of stability and of common experience that Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lacks in the waking world . 
-LRB- Maybe All_Might ($_All_Might) is coming to feel less like something divine and more like family . -RRB- 
When Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) clambers into bed that night , he knows what to do . With his headphones playing a soft song for him , he lays flat on his back , gaze directed upwards towards the ceiling , and closes his eyes . 
He forces his heart to slow , makes himself ease his breathing and focus on the melody leaking into his ears . Breathe in, breathe out. His limbs melt into his bed . 
The music from his headphones gives way to a more all-encompassing hum -- the thrumming of the cosmos , of energy and space . He latches on , sees himself grab a fistful of that energy and watches it drag him into the unknown . 
When he opens his eyes again , he 's not in his familiar forest . 
It 's the Spirit World -- that much Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can tell -- , but it 's nothing like the tranquility of the towering trees he 's grown to know . 
The landscape is best described as a desert -- but rather than sand , it 's covered in dust . A barren horizon : no plants , no buildings , no people . Everything looks gray and dead . The air is dry and scratchy , and every breath feels like an assault on his throat . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) crouches to the ground , sifting a handful of the material through his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) fingers . It feels wrong . Something twinges in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chest and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't say why , but something in the dust feels ... alive ? Tormented ? 
Is there someone buried here ? Was this dust formerly someone ? 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) begins to dig in haste -- looking for what , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) does n't know . But if someone is in trouble , if someone is in pain , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to help , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't just leave them -- 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hand brushes something solid and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) halts for a moment . Then he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) starts again in earnest , frantically clawing at the dust . The thing begins to surface and , to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) horror , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) realizes that it 's a hand . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) falls backwards on his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) butt , scooching away from the object . But it 's too late -- the hand shifts , free from its confinement , and spiders its way out of its dusty prison . 
Several things happen at once . 
The formerly stagnant air whips itself into a frenzy . Dust takes to the air , pelting Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) in sheets , invading his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) clothes , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) throat . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chokes -- more accurately , he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) drowns . 
The hand closes the gap , crawling over his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) foot and clamping onto his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ankle . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wastes air and yelps , flailing his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) leg around desperately in an attempt to get it off . But his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) energy wanes ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sinks , head hitting the ground . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) can only watch the thing with his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes , unable to escape . 
It might just be oxygen deprivation -- but Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's blurring vision witnesses the dust by the hand swirl and combine into a crude attempt at a human body . 
The mass climbs its way up his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) unmoving torso , crushing the remaining air in him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) even faster than before . Its rough head settles right over Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) tries to jerk his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face away but finds that he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't . 
I know what you are , the words come , snake-like and tired and cold . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's eyes widen ; he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) reaches at his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) last scraps of energy and renews his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) efforts to pull away . Instead , a dusty hand clamps down over his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) throat . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) lets out a weak wheeze of agony . 
The thing leans in , almost brushing Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's nose . And then it laughs -- a nasally wheezing noise , a sad mockery of actual laughter . It sends a chill down Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's spine . 
It belts out one more raspy chuckle . If it had a mouth , Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) imagines it would be smiling . 
You think you 're safe ? That the world is safe ? it questions , a note of cruelty tinting its voice . 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's head lulls , his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyelids drooping shut and the tension draining from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) body . 
How naive. 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) eyes are closed and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's barely conscious but the next words are painfully clear . 
You obviously have no idea what 's coming . 
Something wraps firm arms under Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's armpits , yanking him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) under the mound of dust and into the earth . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) swallows dust and sees no more . 
x
A shriek rips its way out of Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's throat as he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bolts upright . 
Escape . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) has to escape . 
There 's something confining his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) legs -- 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) kicks his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) way out from under his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) sheets , stumbling from his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) bed and tripping onto the floor . 
The soft carpeting of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) room . Gentle moonlight trickling in from shuttered windows . Rectangles of bending idols watching over him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) from the walls . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's in the real world . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's safe . 
Muffled footsteps scramble down the hall and his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mother rips open the door , hair ruffled and terror on her face . 
“Izuku! What happened?” 
Midoriya ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't help it . A tiny sob fights its way out of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) chest , then another . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's cried in front of his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mom before . This ($_Midoriya_Izuku) is n't new . 
But it ($_Midoriya_Izuku) feels different -- it ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's embarrassing . He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) 's supposed to hold up the whole world but he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) ca n't even hold himself ($_Midoriya_Izuku) together . 
He ($_Midoriya_Izuku) drops his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) face in his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) hands . 
His ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mom pauses in the doorway , assessing the scene . Then , no questions asked , she glides over and sinks to the floor , wrapping her arms around him ($_Midoriya_Izuku) in a comforting embrace . 
`` There there , Izuku , '' she murmurs , a hand rubbing up and down his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) back . `` It 'll all be okay . You 'll be fine . '' 
But it wo n't . And he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) wo n't . 
How is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) supposed to go back to the Spirit World after that ? 
How is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) supposed to talk to All Might with that thing there ? 
What is that thing ? What is it plotting ? 
How is he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) supposed to stop it ? 
In an instant , the weight of the world comes plummeting onto his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) back and he ($_Midoriya_Izuku) collapses under it , clinging to his ($_Midoriya_Izuku) mother and soaking her unknowing shoulders in the tears of a boy who was still precisely that : 
A boy .
