{"document": "Anthony Edward Stark was a certified genius , a well known billionaire , and an infamous playboy . He had inherited his fortune , that much was true , but he certainly had n't rested on his laurels - he had more than done his part to increase it . He had revolutionised weapons technology in the twenty first century , developing newer , smarter missiles , warheads , guidance systems , defence , in some cases , though he had always lived by his father 's maxim : \" Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy . \" He spent his life on the traditional pleasures : wine , women , and song . Or at least , he did in the public eye . Many wondered how he had gone so long without a single relationship in his life - he could laugh it off easily enough , that was true , but the real truth of it was that there was a fourth love in his life , a demanding mistress , and a relationship which was toxic , occasionally to the extreme . First , and foremost , before anything else , Tony Stark had his work . It was his work which kept him up for 72 hours straight , sometimes more , which left him dizzy with exhaustion , completely worn , but buzzing too much to rest , it was the perfectionist streak in him which drove him to hide there , striving to meet a set of standards imagined in his father 's voice , to which he could never measure up . It was easier to hide in his work , to not let the world see what a weak and pathetic failure he truly was . It had become harder to simply hide in his work after the Avengers initiative had been set up . Team mates had this annoying habit of sticking their noses into business where they did n't belong . He had been under pressure to give the team a home , after all , the rest of them were , for the most part , stuck in SHIELD quarters , and were jealous of the fact that he had taken Doctor Banner in . He liked Bruce , and Bruce understood about work , about science and tech . And the guy did n't have anywhere else to be . He found it reassuring that Bruce kept hours that were almost as erratic and unhealthy as Tony 's own . It somehow condoned his own slow self destruction . He never took Christmas off , but nobody knew that - why would they ? It was easy to duck out of social engagements , because as far as everyone was concerned it was almost certain that he would have another engagement , a prior one , or a more impressive one , which outranked theirs , and so he played those off against each other . He gave the staff of Stark Tower - few though there were - the day off , at the very least , the week , for all non - essential staff , and so there was no one , had never been anyone , to bear witness to Tony Stark spending Christmas alone in his workshop with a bottle or three of scotch , and the bots . He never achieved anything productive , but losing himself in work sure beat all the forced cheer he could never quite stomach . It was Christmas Eve , late , midnight possibly ? He did n't know , he was n't keeping track , engineering blindly on a tide of caffeine and alcohol . He hardly drank these days , but it helped keep the memories at bay . Memories of Christmas ... he had enough for a lifetime . He did n't buy all the bullshit about the true spirit of the holiday . How could he ? He knew for a fact it did n't exist . He had n't slept in twenty four hours , and so was n't surprised when the workshop began to waver . Had he eaten ? He was n't quite sure of that either ... He was quite surprised , though , when Captain Steve Rogers appeared before him , and seemingly guided him to sit on the couch he kept in the workshop for those occasions when he passed out , handing him a plate with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on it , the same way he usually did when he was of the opinion Tony needed to eat something , whether that be before a mission , after a mission ... after a bender , first thing in the morning , last thing at night ... the man seemed to have a complex about food , but then , Tony supposed , if you were used to there not being much of it around , the novelty of having plenty never quite wore off . Tony tried to ask him what he was doing there , but the man just smiled , and so , irritated , Tony took a swipe , only half in play , and blinked as his hand went right through Steve 's chest , or where his eyes were telling him Steve 's chest should be . Well , this was a first , he 'd never hallucinated Steve Rogers before , but that being said , it was a hallucination he would have been quite happy to have again . \" Well , I guess it 's kinda neat that you picked my face for the past , even if it is n't really a surprise ... I 'm kinda wondering why you did n't pick your dad , except ... well , I guess we 're about to find out about that ... \" he smiled sadly \" I get that this time of year is n't easy for you ... mind if we take a look at the old days ? Seeing as I did n't get to live through them myself ... \" Tony was more than a little wary of the idea of looking through the old memories . As far as he was concerned , he kept them back for a reason . He did n't need the years of coldness freezing his non - existent heart all over again . The Steve - vision took his hand , and Tony could n't quite suppress the part of his brain that noted ' oh so that 's interesting , if he initiates the contact , then there 's a pressure , a sensation , but if /you/ initiate the contact ... you 're waving your hand through thin air , looking like an idiot . ' He followed the strange ghost from the workshop - after all , if it really was just a hallucination , then it was n't like anyone else was there to see him making an idiot of himself . They went up , first , and overlayed in the living space which he was used to seeing filled either with builders , or with his team mates after a mission was a towering tree , at least ten feet tall , and perfectly decorated . The family that sat around it could have been from a Christmas card , except for their expressions . The young boy was sitting on the floor , back to his father , dark eyes shuttered , alone . Howard had a glass of whisky in his hand , just like always , and Maria cowered from whatever rant was currently making his old man 's lips curl with hate , the occasional drop of spittle landing on her face which she made no move to wipe off . The Steve - ghost 's eyes crinkled a little , and Tony could see genuine grief there , confusion that a friend he had looked up to so much could have become so bitter , so rotten inside ... the truth was that it was easy for Stark men to fall from grace . Watching his father , watching himself when he had been younger ... he had no trust for himself left . He knew that it would n't take much to turn him into a monster that was no different from Howard , and so he refused to give people the chance , pushed them away . It was easier that way . That was n't the only memory , of course ... they walked through other rooms , other Christmases he only wanted to forget , ones he had spent alone with a pile of presents bought without consideration of what he might truly want or need , ones he had been coerced into spending with Obie ... memory after memory that left him shaking and sick , trying and failing to keep tears back from his cheeks . At the end of it all , the thing , this thing that looked like Steve but was n't , could n't possibly be , turned to him , rested a hand on his shoulder for a moment , used that hand to tilt Tony 's head up to meet those impossibly blue eyes . \" I 'm sorry for what happened to you , Tony , \" he said , \" But you need to know that you are not your father . You never have been . You are a thousand times the man your father was . Do n't let him hold you back . You 're better than that . \" With that , the spirit dissipated into thin air as simply as it had appeared , leaving Tony to crumple to his knees on the hard , cold floor , face in his hands , tears he had refused to shed burning trails down his cheeks . The next pressure on his shoulder was different , warm , solid , but not sheer strength in the same way Steve 's was . He knew , before he looked up , that it would be Bruce . He did n't know where these visions were coming from , what the point of them could possibly be ... but he had to admit his mind could construct them perfectly , down to the last detail . Those kind brown eyes , so much older than his although there was only a few years difference smile down at him , and the thumb rough from lab work , from travel , from a hard life , well lived , skimmed his cheekbone , cool against the heat of the tears there . He guided Tony up , and squeezed him briefly . \" You do n't have to cut yourself off like this , you know ... \" Tony did n't know what to say to that , tried to open his mouth to defend himself , but felt a lump in his throat , which would n't go away , no matter how he tried to clear it . \" Let 's have a look at the alternatives ... \" They began to walk again , through the tower , through parts of it even Tony did n't recognise , the parts he had considered making into space for the team , before he had remembered that they would n't want to live with him anyway , and that he was so much better off without them intruding , and always being underfoot , and wanting to change him , lecturing him , forcing him to eat and drink , and live like a normal person . It was the top floor , first , the one he would have given to Clint , obviously . It looked like SHIELD quarters , from what he could remember of them , and Clint was sitting on the bed , bow in his hands , turning it over and over , his quiver beside him on the bed . Someone had stuck a bow onto it , and there were two single solitary cards . \" He went to the SHIELD Christmas party . Did n't stay long , he does n't feel at home in places like that , he feels out of place , and unwanted , he knows the others are n't comfortable with him anyway . I mean , they were n't before New York , but since ... \" Bruce shrugged \" He does n't really have a place , except with the other Avengers . Coulson will come in , in a bit , and spend some time with him , but neither of them really get into the holiday spirit these days . Clint 's never had a proper Christmas . \" \" Yeh well ... he 's not the only one , is he . \" Tony could n't quite keep back the bitter reply , but then , he would n't have been himself if he had , and so he did n't regret it . Bruce 's reply was mild , though , as it always was \" No , he is n't ... Natasha is on a mission , even on Christmas . She prefers it to having to think about things but everyone has their coping mechanisms ... \" \" And what about you ? Where are you ? \" \" Steve invited me down to a charity thing at a local orphanage and foster home . They 're all wild to see Captain America . Not so happy about me , but they welcomed me all the same . After that , we go home . In Steve 's case , to an empty room , where he can remember every single person he has lost , because he has nothing that he might have gained . No friend , no team mate , because he has lost everything he ever knew . The world he once had . In my case to an unlit tower , empty apart from the one person in this world I might count as a friend , and who will never let me in . \" \" I- ... \" Tony went to protest , but realised he had no basis for it . He did n't let Bruce in . He did n't let anyone in . It was how this worked . How he worked . It was safer that way , for him , and them . There were only so many times a heart could break before it became irreparable , after all , and it was a gamble he had long ago decided was not worth taking . If even his parents could n't love him , what was the chance of anyone else wanting him . \" Thor is at home for Christmas , because the one thing he has taken from it is that it 's a time that 's meant to be spent with family ... he 's not close to his father anymore , though , after what happened with Loki , who is still in prison , and is n't willing to speak to him , and his mother is by his father 's side all the time . He 'd rather spend it here , with the family he 's chosen .... except that it seems that family has made it clear that they do n't want him either . \" \" Hey , what- ... \" \" They chose not to spend Christmas together , to Thor that means that for all that they are his family , he does n't mean enough to them , and they do n't mean enough to each other , to spend the time together . \" \" ... Oh ... \" well , that made sense at least , and goddamn if that did n't make Tony feel like a terrible person , \" I ... uh ... \" Bruce shrugged , and gave him that little smile which meant ' I am disappointed in you but I know you did n't mean it , so I still love you anyway ' . Tony was more than familiar with that smile . \" ... I do n't ... I do n't want them to be alone ... I do n't want them to be upset , I just ... how do I fix it ? \" The spirit Bruce laughed . \" You 're good at fixing things Tony ... but to fix this , you need to fix yourself a little bit , first . When you 've fixed yourself enough to let other people help you ... then you 'll open up a whole new world of opportunities . A whole new future . I know you can do it . Do you want to see what it could be like if you do ? \" He did n't even hesitate before nodding , his innate inventor 's curiousity getting the better of him . Bruce chuckled at that , too , and gestured back to the elevator . \" I ca n't show you that , Tony ... only you can see it , because it 's a future that 's inextricably wound around you ... you need to be led by a part of yourself to see that ... \" \" I do n't ... what the fuck does that even mean ? ! \" Bruce pointed , and a glowing blue ball waited by the elevator . \" Jarvis will show you what will happen if you fix this ... what you can create ... \" Tony had been about to argue , but then , for the second time that night , he closed his mouth . Of course it made sense - or as much sense as any of this was making - that it was Jarvis . Jarvis and the bots ... definitely had a bit of him in them , a bit of his soul , his spirit ... in Jarvis ' case , and occasionally Dummy 's possibly too much . But he loved them . He refused to change them . And so , without glancing back to see where his mind told him Bruce had been standing , he followed the blue light . They went to the roof , and it was cold there , Tony could certainly feel that , but the skies were clear , and this high up , he could even see a few stars as his breath misted in the air . There was a fire burning in a special fireplace in the middle of the roof terrace , and seven figures surrounded it , all seemingly roasting marshmallows , wrapped up warm in coats , and scarves and gloves . There was laughter , the occasional goodnatured curse , and an undercurrent of music that seemed to ebb and flow around the circle . He could pick out all their voices , he found ... Thor 's was amazingly melodic , but the volume made it obvious . Natasha 's , too , was pretty clear , sweet and high , like a songbird . Bruce was surprisingly warm , and blended well with Clint 's which was pleasantly rough . Steve , of course , had the voice of the chorister he had once been , till his health had become too poor , and Coulson ... Coulson did n't sing . But he hummed along with the archer who was emphatically settled in his arms . \" Thanks for this Tony ... it 's nice to spend Christmas ... \" Bruce shrugged , and Tony knew him well enough to read the rest of the sentence in it ' not alone ' , ' at home ' , there were so many things written in that simple movement ... and he could read them all , understand them all , feel them all ... because he felt the same , and his stomach twisted a little at the thought of what it would be like to have a family like this , to spend the holidays with them , to be with people who wanted to be with him ... he could n't quite wrap his head around it , but his reactor ached in his chest , and he knew he wanted to try . \" And the tree is great ! \" That was Clint \" I ca n't wait for tomorrow , me and Bruce have split the cooking , it 's going to be amazing ... \" Even Natasha did n't look as uncomfortable as he would have anticipated Christmas making her . \" Truly , Friend Tony ... or perhaps , if I may call you brother , \" well , that was Thor , \" It is a great honour that you do me by permitting me to spend this mortal festival with those I consider to be like family to me . I understand the importance of celebrating that at this time , and I feel there is nowhere more proper for me to be than by your sides . \" \" Hear , hear . \" That was Bruce , and he heard the clinking of glasses , or , in Thor 's case , a bottle . He stood , frozen in place for a long moment , and watched them continue , all those familiar faces lit by the orange glow ... and there was real joy in them , not just the sadness that he usually associated with this time of year . It was strange to think that there might be hope , but then , if all the bullshit was to be believed , if there was hope at any time of year , it was at Christmas . Eventually the vision faded , and he was left standing on the roof terrace , barefoot , in jeans and a t - shirt , feeling like an ice block . He shook himself and headed straight back inside . It was n't too late , right ? It could n't be too late , not at Christmas . He considered getting Jarvis to put the calls out , but that was n't personal enough , so he had grabbed his cellphone , and called everyone he could reach . There was no real way of getting through to Asgard , so he had to hope Thor would somehow magically get the hint ... unless Doctor Foster knew something ... he checked in with her too , and cracked his knuckles , pulling on a scarf , a coat , some boots , and heading out to get everything they would need . Sure , there would n't be much left at this stage , but what the hell , he was Tony Stark , it was n't like money was an object , and for once , there was something more important . They had all answered their phones - there had n't really been that much of a chance that they would n't , even at midnight on Christmas Eve . Coulson had informed him that Natasha was back early from her mission , and that the SHIELD trio would arrive by half past the hour - that gave him almost no time , or did n't until he asked them to pick up some things on the way . Steve had jumped at the chance , and was practically on his scooter by the time Tony had given him his shopping list . Bruce was with him , and had rolled his eyes but obliged , and Jane Foster had somehow managed to communicate to Thor that he was needed back on Earth . Back at the tower , cold , overtired , overexcited , shaking a little with sheer exhaustion , every inch of Tony 's body seemed to be humming as he grinned at them all , assembled again . It was Natasha who broke the silence , with her traditional sardonically quirked eyebrow . \" What the hell got into you , Stark ? \" \" I figured just because family might teach you that Christmas is shit ... maybe the family you choose is more important than blood . I had a little sense knocked into me . We 're a team , and we do n't .... none of us have to be alone anymore . \" He saw the way Steve smiled at him then , the approval on Bruce 's face , and he felt the colour rising in his own cheeks . \" Not even me . \"", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [0, 3], "text": "Anthony Edward Stark"}, {"position": [18, 19], "text": "He"}, {"position": [21, 22], "text": "his"}, {"position": [30,
