{"document": "Before the housemaid had lit their fire the next day , or the sun gained any power over a cold , gloomy morning in January , Marianne , only half dressed , was kneeling against one of the window - seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it , and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her . In this situation , Elinor , roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs , first perceived her ; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety , said , in a tone of the most considerate gentleness , Marianne , may I ask ? No , Elinor , she replied , ask nothing ; you will soon know all . The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said , lasted no longer than while she spoke , and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction . It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby . Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power ; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more , had not Marianne entreated her , with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability , not to speak to her for the world . In such circumstances , it was better for both that they should not be long together ; and the restless state of Marianne s mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed , but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place , made her wander about the house till breakfast time , avoiding the sight of every body . At breakfast she neither ate , nor attempted to eat any thing ; and Elinor s attention was then all employed , not in urging her , not in pitying her , nor in appearing to regard her , but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jennings s notice entirely to herself . As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings , it lasted a considerable time , and they were just setting themselves , after it , round the common working table , when a letter was delivered to Marianne , which she eagerly caught from the servant , and , turning of a death - like paleness , instantly ran out of the room . Elinor , who saw as plainly by this , as if she had seen the direction , that it must come from Willoughby , felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head , and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings s notice . That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking . Of Elinor s distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said ,", "clusters": [{"mentions": [{"position": [26, 27], "text": "Marianne"}, {"position": [49, 50], "text": "she"}, {"position": [67, 68], "text": "her"}, {"position": [86, 87], "text": "her"}, {"position": [91, 92], "text": "her"}, {"position": [111, 112], "text": "Marianne"}, {"position": [121, 122], "text": "she"}, {"position": [149, 150], "text": "she"}, {"position": [170, 171], "text": "she"}, {"position": [175, 176], "text": "her"}, {"position": [187, 188], "text": "her"}, {"position": [194, 195], "text": "her"}, {"position": [201, 202], "text": "her"}, {"position": [210, 211], "text": "she"}, {"position": [222, 223], "text": "her"}, {"position": [241, 242], "text": "her"}, {"position": [247, 248], "text": "Marianne"}, {"position": [298, 299], "text": "her"}, {"position": [307, 308], "text": "she"}, {"position": [323, 324], "text": "her"}, {"position": [429, 430], "text": "Marianne"}, {"position": [432, 433], "text": "she"}, {"position": [527, 528], "text": "Marianne"}, {"position": [558, 559], "text": "she"}, {"position": [601, 602], "text": "Marianne"}], "name": "Marianne"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [73, 74], "text": "Elinor"}, {"position": [79, 80], "text": "her"}, {"position": [114, 115], "text": "I"}, {"position": [119, 120], "text": "Elinor"}, {"position": [127, 128], "text": "you"}, {"position": [220, 221], "text": "Elinor"}, {"position": [229, 230], "text": "her"}, {"position": [233, 234], "text": "she"}, {"position": [249, 250], "text": "her"}, {"position": [265, 266], "text": "her"}, {"position": [341, 342], "text": "she"}, {"position": [353, 354], "text": "Elinor"}, {"position": [364, 365], "text": "her"}, {"position": [369, 370], "text": "her"}, {"position": [376, 377], "text": "her"}, {"position": [389, 390], "text": "herself"}], "name": "Elinor"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [383, 385], "text": "Mrs. Jennings"}, {"position": [398, 400], "text": "Mrs. Jennings"}, {"position": [513, 515], "text": "Mrs. Jennings"}, {"position": [518, 521], "text": "That good lady"}, {"position": [538, 539], "text": "her"}, {"position": [546, 547], "text": "she"}, {"position": [563, 564], "text": "her"}, {"position": [571, 572], "text": "she"}, {"position": [595, 596], "text": "her"}, {"position": [604, 605], "text": "she"}], "name": "Mrs. Jennings"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [456, 457], "text": "Elinor"}, {"position": [467, 468], "text": "she"}, {"position": [489, 490], "text": "her"}, {"position": [495, 496], "text": "her"}, {"position": [507, 508], "text": "her"}, {"position": [582, 583], "text": "her"}], "name": "Elinor"}, {"mentions": [{"position": [218, 219], "text": "Willoughby"}, {"position": [478, 479], "text": "Willoughby"}, {"position": [533, 534], "text": "Willoughby"}], "name": "Willoughby"}]}
