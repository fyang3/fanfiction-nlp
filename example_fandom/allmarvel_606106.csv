606106,1,1,"Anthony Edward Stark was a certified genius, a well known billionaire, and an infamous playboy. He had inherited his fortune, that much was true, but he certainly hadn't rested on his laurels - he had more than done his part to increase it. He had revolutionised weapons technology in the twenty first century, developing newer, smarter missiles, warheads, guidance systems, defence, in some cases, though he had always lived by his father's maxim: ""Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.""","Anthony Edward Stark was a certified genius , a well known billionaire , and an infamous playboy .

606106,1,2,"He spent his life on the traditional pleasures: wine, women, and song. Or at least, he did in the public eye. Many wondered how he had gone so long without a single relationship in his life - he could laugh it off easily enough, that was true, but the real truth of it was that there was a fourth love in his life, a demanding mistress, and a relationship which was toxic, occasionally to the extreme. First, and foremost, before anything else, Tony Stark had his work. It was his work which kept him up for 72 hours straight, sometimes more, which left him dizzy with exhaustion, completely worn, but buzzing too much to rest, it was the perfectionist streak in him which drove him to hide there, striving to meet a set of standards imagined in his father's voice, to which he could never measure up. It was easier to hide in his work, to not let the world see what a weak and pathetic failure he truly was.","He spent his life on the traditional pleasures : wine , women , and song .

606106,1,3,"It had become harder to simply hide in his work after the Avengers initiative had been set up. Team mates had this annoying habit of sticking their noses into business where they didn't belong. He had been under pressure to give the team a home, after all, the rest of them were, for the most part, stuck in SHIELD quarters, and were jealous of the fact that he had taken Doctor Banner in. He liked Bruce, and Bruce understood about work, about science and tech. And the guy didn't have anywhere else to be. He found it reassuring that Bruce kept hours that were almost as erratic and unhealthy as Tony's own. It somehow condoned his own slow self destruction.","It had become harder to simply hide in his work after the Avengers initiative had been set up .

It was easy to duck out of social engagements, because as far as everyone was concerned it was almost certain that he would have another engagement, a prior one, or a more impressive one, which outranked theirs, and so he played those off against each other. He gave the staff of Stark Tower - few though there were - the day off, at the very least, the week, for all non-essential staff, and so there was no one, had never been anyone, to bear witness to Tony Stark spending Christmas alone in his workshop with a bottle or three of scotch, and the bots. He never achieved anything productive, but losing himself in work sure beat all the forced cheer he could never quite stomach.","He never took Christmas off , but nobody knew that - why would they ?
